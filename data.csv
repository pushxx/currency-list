IOTA,IOTA,iota,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1720.png,coin,"## What Is IOTA (MIOTA)?



IOTA is a distributed ledger with one big difference: it isn’t actually a blockchain. Instead, its proprietary technology is known as Tangle, a system of nodes that confirm transactions. The foundation behind this platform says this offers far greater speeds than conventional blockchains — and an ideal footprint for the ever-expanding Internet of Things ecosystem.

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [IOTA](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-iota).
 

Because there’s no blockchain, there are no miners, and because there are no miners, there are no fees. Many established networks see costs balloon when congestion intensifies, but IOTA aims to provide limitless throughput at minimal expense.

 

In time, IOTA’s goal is to become the de facto platform for executing transactions between IoT devices. Given how estimates suggest there could be 20.4 billion such devices out there by 2024, this could end up being big business.

 

The team behind IOTA believe that the potential use cases don’t end here. They believe their distributed ledger could deliver digital identities to all, result in car insurance policies that are based on actual usage, pave the way for cutting-edge smart cities, deliver seamless global trade and prove the authenticity of products.

 

Originally known as Jinn, a crowdsale for the project was held in September 2014, and the network officially launched in 2016.


## Who Are the Founders of IOTA?



IOTA has [four co-founders](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/07/03/iota-cofounders-on-how-past-mistakes-have-shaped-them-today/), and their names are Sergey Ivancheglo, Serguei Popov, David Sønstebø and Dominik Schiener.

 

According to the IOTA Foundation, the initiative has rapidly grown since then — and team members are now based across more than 25 countries.

 

Sonstebo and Schiener are collectively co-chairmen of the board of directors, while Popov is a board member and the foundation’s director of research.

 

Ivancheglo resigned from the Berlin-based project back in June 2019 but continues as an unofficial advisor. At the time, he said in a statement: “I no longer believe that the IOTA Foundation is the best setting for me to realize what we set out to create back in 2014 and 2015. I have always done my best work in a less rigid environment. I am looking forward to continuing the work on both hardware and software development of IOTA independently.”


### What Makes IOTA Unique?



Well, as we alluded to a little earlier, the fact that it’s effectively a blockchainless blockchain is rather unusual to say the least.

 

Tangle’s more technical name is the Directed Acyclic Graph — and as Sønstebø explained in a blog post back in 2015, this technology aims to retain blockchain’s ability to execute secure transactions. The only difference is that it does away with the notion of blocks.

 

He also wrote: “IOTA should not be considered an alternative coin (altcoin) to existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, rather it is an extension of the growing blockchain ecosystem. It’s meant to work in synergy with these other platforms to form cohesion and symbiotic relationships. IOTA is designed to provide one solution that no other crypto does: efficient, secure, lightweight, real-time micro-transactions without fees.”

 

New transactions are validated by approving two previous transactions from another node — and this is a novel approach because it means that the network’s size and speed will be directly related to how many people are using the platform.

 

And whereas some cryptocurrencies are run as a business, the IOTA Foundation says it is firmly not for profit — adding that it has the sole goal of making the network as prosperous as possible.

 

Finally, IOTA has distinguished itself from many other crypto rivals by establishing high-profile partnerships with the carmaker Volkswagen, and helping the city of Taipei to pursue smart projects.

### How Many IOTA (MIOTA) Coins Are There In Circulation?



MIOTA has a maximum supply of 2,779,530,283 tokens — and all of them are in circulation.

 

When the crowdsale was held, this digital asset was billed as a utility token that could be used for payment across its network, rather than a profit-sharing coin.

 

An incredibly precise 999,999,999 were sold during the 2015 crowdsale, and this generated revenue of 1,337 BTC for the foundation. Given that Bitcoin was only worth about $325 at the time, this could have resulted in a substantial windfall for the team in later years.

 

It is worth noting that the supply of MIOTA did increase in later years, with the team arguing that a greater level of supply would make the token suitable for the “tiny nano transactions” that we’ll likely see through IoT devices.

 

The IOTA Foundation launched in October 2017, and at the time, it owned approximately 5% of the tokens that are in circulation, and these were donated by the community. It said “the majority of these funds will go towards building an army of developers and researchers.”


### How Is the IOTA Network Secured?



Given how the IOTA network isn’t a blockchain, you may not think that it would have much need for a consensus mechanism. However, to help keep the network secure, a relatively straightforward Proof-of-Work puzzle is included in the process of validating a transaction.

 

There have been security concerns surrounding IOTA. In the past, researchers have claimed they have found vulnerabilities in the project’s code.


### Where Can You Buy IOTA (MIOTA)?



MIOTA is available on multiple exchanges — many people choose to [buy MIOTA](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-MIOTA) on Binance, Bitfinex, and OKEx. According to the project, a range of trading pairs are available, linking the token with Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and fiat currencies including the Japanese yen, euro, pound, and dollar.[ Learn more about fiat on-ramps here.](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/)""","{""website"":[""https://www.iota.org/""],""technical_doc"":[""https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf""],""explorer"":[""http://explorer.iota.org/?"",""https://bscscan.com/token/0xd944f1d1e9d5f9bb90b62f9d45e447d989580782"",""https://bscscan.com/token/0xd944f1d1e9d5f9bb90b62f9d45e447d989580782""],""source_code"":[""https://github.com/iotaledger""],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/IOTA"",""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/iota"",""https://forum.iota.org""],""chat"":[""https://discord.iota.org/""],""announcement"":[""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1216479.0""],""reddit"":[""https://reddit.com/r/Iota""],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/iota""]}",[],"[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9017.png"",""Name"":""Ledger"",""URL"":""https://www.ledger.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9020.png"",""Name"":""Trezor"",""URL"":""https://www.trezor.io/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9058.png"",""Name"":""Math Wallet"",""URL"":""http://www.mathwallet.org/cn/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9022.png"",""Name"":""Trust Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.trustwallet.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9025.png"",""Name"":""MetaMask"",""URL"":""https://metamask.io/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9150.png"",""Name"":""Trinity"",""URL"":""https://trinity.iota.org/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9152.png"",""Name"":""Binance Chain Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/""}]",[]

Horizen,ZEN,horizen,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1698.png,coin,"## What Is Horizen (ZEN)?

Horizen is a zero-knowledge-enabled network of blockchains powered by the largest node infrastructure in the industry. Blockchain interoperability is enabled by the Zendoo protocol, which uses SNARK-verification and allows for complete flexibility in sidechain type, consensus, speed, and privacy. Cryptographic verification of networked chains offers massive scale, and the network currently supports up to 10,000 sidechains with a throughput limit of 10,000,000 TPS.


Zendoo makes Horizen a permissionless network of blockchains. Developers can deploy their blockchains within the ecosystem using a variety of SDKs. The first set of SDKs, Blaze and Latus, deploy blockchains based on IOHK's provably secure Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol. Blaze offers high-speed chains that declare their own certifiers and can run up to 1,000 TPS, while Latus uses a recursive SNARK composition for full decentralization. The next set of SDKs will include EVM integration for Ethereum smart contract compatibility.

Horizen's native cryptocurrency, ZEN, is a mineable PoW coin currently trading on major exchanges, including Coinbase, Bittrex, and Binance. ZEN can be staked to participate in Horizen's nearly 50,000 full node network.


## Who Are the Founders of Horizen?

The founders of Horizen are Rob Viglione and Rolf Versluis.

Dr. Rob Viglione is the co-founder and CEO of Horizen Labs and the co-founder and team lead of the Zen Blockchain Foundation. He holds a Ph.D. in Finance, an MBA in Finance and Marketing, and a Bachelor's in Physics & Applied Mathematics. Additionally, Rob has been an advisor to some of the most transformational blockchain projects globally, including Aave, and he previously worked as a scientist in the space industry.

Rolf Versluis is the co-founder and executive advisor of the Zen Blockchain Foundation. He is an experienced business owner in the IT industry and owns a mid-size mining operation. In the past, Rolf worked at Cisco Systems, the semiconductor industry, and as a nuclear-trained officer in the US Submarine force.

Jane Lippencott was a member of the founding team and co-author of the original whitepaper. She is now a partner at a16z Crypto, the digital asset unit of venture investing giant Andreessen Horowitz, and was previously an associate at Winklevoss Capital. Jane is a 2021 VC Cohort at All Rise, an advisor at Teller Finance, and a mentor at the Open Web Collective, as well as a mentor at Celo and Katapult Accelerator. She is a contributor at Nakamoto.com. She worked as a mentor at Blockchain for Social Impact Coalition (BSIC), a mentor at dLab and a mentor at Ethereum Classic Labs, an advisor at Unbounded Capital, a mentor at Techstars, and was a member of the Board at Cord.


## What Makes Horizen Unique?

Horizen is known for its expertise in zero-knowledge-based blockchain technology. Their team has made several advancements in the cryptography space, including their zero-knowledge privacy tool library, called Ginger-Lib, and for the release of one of the first zero-knowledge-based scalability solutions.  

Their blockchain network provides a unique sidechain solution that allows developers to build their own scalable blockchains with the ability to support tens of thousands of transactions per second while maintaining true decentralization across tens of thousands of nodes. Horizen also offers unique optional privacy features.

[Horizen](https://horizen.io/) is a fully decentralized zero-knowledge-enabled blockchain ecosystem that offers massive scalability and optional privacy features. Horizen features Zendoo, a sidechain system that enables the deployment of thousands of independent sidechains that communicate with the mainchain and each other. 

Blockchain transactions are verified by network nodes, which requires significant computational power. This is why most blockchain networks have a cap on the number of transactions they can process at any given time. However, developers on Horizen can operate more than 10,000 independent blockchains simultaneously while handling up to 10 million transactions per second across all sidechains (an average TPS of 1,000 per chain). This is largely due to Horizen’s node network being one of the largest and most distributed networks in the industry. This enables their network to be fully decentralized while maintaining high throughput for transactions across the network. 

Horizen is decentralized on the technical level and is moving towards being fully decentralized on the governance level with initiatives like Zen Improvement Proposals and the Horizen Community Council. Horizen uses the [ZenIP process](https://hde.horizen.io/zenip-process) to standardize the process of suggesting major changes to the Horizen code base and ecosystem.

ZEN is the native cryptocurrency for the Horizen ecosystem.

## How Many Horizen (ZEN) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Horizen has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins, of which just over 11,700,000 are in circulation as of November 2021.

Horizen has one of the largest node networks with a multi-tiered node system. The operators receive 20% of the total block subsidy, and the dispersed node network provides an extensive infrastructure to operate an ecosystem of both applications and sidechains.

When it comes to mining ZEN, it is an ASIC-mineable cryptocurrency that employs the Equihash algorithm. Block rewards 60% miners, 20% treasury, and 20% nodes.


## How Is the Horizen Network Secured?

Horizen utilizes a combination of Proof-of-Work in their mainchain and Proof-of-Stake in their sidechains. Each PoS sidechain built on the Horizen network is pegged to the mainchain and runs simultaneously. The mainchain acts as a ‘truth engine’ for all blockchains built on the network. 

Horizen uses zk-SNARKs to allow the communication between sidechains and the mainchain without having the mainchain know the sidechain logic and the internal structure. This approach keeps the mainchain completely decoupled from the sidechain’s logic and allows the whole system to scale possible applications and global transaction throughput. On the other hand, the usage of zk-SNARKs within the sidechains enables developers to build applications that preserve the users’ privacy, allowing the development of a wide variety of real-world use cases to be built on their network. 

The Horizen blockchain network uses secure nodes which are TLS encrypted to enable secure inter-node communication. ZEN uses the Equihash consensus algorithm, which supports ASIC mining and offers shielded transactions that can mask the sender, recipient, and value transacted.


## Where Can You Buy Horizen (ZEN)?

Horizen (ZEN) can be purchased, sold and traded at major cryptocurrency exchanges such as:

XRP,XRP,xrp,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/52.png,coin,"## What Is XRP / XRP Ledger?

Launched in 2021, the [XRP Ledger (XRPL)](http://www.xrpl.org) is an open-source, permissionless and decentralized technology. Benefits of the XRP Ledger include its low-cost ($0.0002 to transact), speed  (settling transactions in 3-5 seconds), scalability (1,500 transactions per second) and inherently green attributes (carbon-neutral and energy-efficient). The XRP Ledger also features the first decentralized exchange (DEX) and custom tokenization capabilities built into the protocol. Since 2012, the XRP Ledger has been operating reliably, having closed 70 million ledgers. 


### Who Are the Founders of the XRP Ledger?

In 2012, David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb and Arthur Britto launched the XRP Ledger with its native currency XRP as a faster, more energy-efficient alternative to the Bitcoin blockchain. In September that year, along with Chris Larsen, they founded the company that is today known as Ripple.


#### What Makes XRPL Unique?

The XRP Ledger presents a wide variety of applications and use cases related to payments including micropayments, DeFi, and, soon, NFTs. Deployed in 2012, the XRPL supports enterprises and Python, Java and JavaScript developers with powerful utility and flexibility. On the XRP website, developers can access different tutorials to help them get started using different coding languages, building apps, managing accounts and more. 

Alongside its native coin, XRP, the XRP Ledger is used by developers to create solutions that solve inefficiencies, including remittance and asset tokenization. Currently, the five main applications of the XRP Ledger are payments, tokenization, DeFi, CBDCs and stablecoins.


#### How Many XRP Coins Are There in Circulation?

The XRP Ledger architects gifted 80 billion XRP to Ripple so that the company could build use cases — including its global payments network, RippleNet — around the digital asset.


### How Is the XRP Ledger Network Secured?

Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, the XRPL uses a unique Federated Consensus mechanism as its method of validating transactions. Transactions are confirmed on the XRPL through a consensus protocol, in which designated independent servers called validators come to an agreement on the order and outcome of XRP transactions. All servers in the network process each transaction according to the same rules, and any transaction that follows the protocol is confirmed right away. All transactions are public and transparent, and anyone can operate a validator. There are currently over 150 validators on the ledger, operated by universities, exchanges, businesses, and individuals around the world. 

Through the Federated Consensus mechanism, all verified transactions can be processed without a single point of failure as no single participant makes a decision independently.


### Where Can You Buy XRP?
XRP is listed on many CeFi exchanges globally, including Binance, Huobi and Bitstamp.

### Ripple and the SEC

Since late 2020, Ripple Labs, the creators of the XRP token, has been locked in a legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The big question is whether or not XRP is a security.

On Dec. 22, 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs and two of its executives on the grounds that they traded $1.3 billion in their XRP token as security without registering it with the commission. There have been arguments for and against the lawsuit. However, Ripple has strongly countered the claims, arguing that the SEC has been biased in its assessment.

The SEC uses the “Howey test,” based on the Supreme Court ruling on SEC v. W.J. Howey Co in 1946, to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security. An asset is considered a security if it is sold with the expectation of getting profits from the efforts of other parties. Based on the commission’s definition of XRP in its lawsuit, the cryptocurrency would pass the Howey test, and according to SEC regulations, all securities must be registered.

While most companies targeted by the SEC in a similar matter chose to settle, Ripple decided to fight. The outcome of the lawsuit will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications in the crypto space. If Ripple prevails, the SEC could lose some of its credibility, giving other crypto-based companies the confidence to revolt. On the flip side, if the SEC wins the case, it could upend the way crypto firms operate and usher in a new wave of registration rules that apply to securities.

Pax Dollar,USDP,paxos-standard,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3330.png,token,"## What Is Pax Dollar (USDP)?

Founded in September of 2018, Pax Dollar is a flat-collateralized [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin). Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to minimize the volatility of the price of the stablecoin, relative to a certain stable asset or a basket of assets. 

A stablecoin can be pegged to a cryptocurrency or flat money. In some cases, it can even be traded for commodities. Pax Dollar offers the advantage of transacting with blockchain assets through minimized price risk. The Pax Dollar tokens (USDP) are issued as[ ERC-20 tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/erc20/) on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain and are collateralized 1:1 through the USD held in Paxos-owned US bank accounts.


## Who Are the Founders of Pax Dollar?

The Pax Dollar was created by Charles Cascarilla and Rich Teo.

Charles Cascarilla is the CEO and co-founder of Paxos. He is also the founding board member of the Association for Digital Asset Markets (ADAM), and a partner at Liberty City Ventures.

He also co-founded and is a partner at Cedar Hill Capital Partners, and his past experience includes a portfolio manager at Claiborne Capital Management, financial analyst at Goldman Sachs and analyst at the Bank of America.

Rich Teo is the second co-founder of Paxos. Before that, he worked as a principal/senior Analyst at Cedar Hill Capital Partners. He was also a financial analyst at Citi, and a combat signaler at the Singapore Armed Forces. 


### What Makes Pax Dollar Unique?

The Pax Dollar is a stablecoin that allows any user to exchange U.S. dollars for the Pax Dollar Tokens. Its main goal is to stabilize the dollar with blockchain technology. 

The Paxos company has a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services that allows them to offer regulated services within the crypto asset world. The token itself is backed by the USD in accounts that are held by the company at the U.S. depository institutions. 

Pax Dollar was built in order to improve the larger financial ecosystem through the creation of a frictionless global network. Here, all digital assets can be mobilized quickly, with a high level of flexibility and accessibility. Paxos’s goal is to create a future where digital assets, commodities and securities can be transferred anywhere, anytime.

## How Many Pax Dollar (USDP) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Pax Dollar combines the U.S. dollar’s stability with the efficiency of blockchain technology. It is a digital dollar, and like other crypto assets can be moved instantaneously anywhere in the world throughout any time of the day. It is stable and is backed 1:1 for the dollar, as well as issued by the Paxos Trust Company. This means that the funds are carefully protected, audited and regulated.


## How Is the Pax Dollar Network Secured?

The Pax Dollar (USDP) can be transacted over the Ethereum blockchain in the same way as[ Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ether-1/) or any other[ ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/erc20/) asset. If a user wants to redeem USDP, they can send tokens to an address controlled by Paxos that will destroy the tokens and transfer flat currency to the user’s bank account. Through this existence on a public blockchain, it can allow traders and exchanges to use USDP as an alternative to flat currencies and can help them outsource their banking requirements to Paxos. This also allows Paxos to easily be integrated with the Ethereum based applications easily.

When there is a security threat, Paxos can pause transfers and approvals of the USDP Token. This ability to pause is controlled by a single owner role, such as OpenZeppelin’s ownable. The model follows OpenZeppelin’s Pausable. OpenZeppelin contracts help you minimize risk by using tested libraries of smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchains. 

Due to the fact that it has a regulated trust, Paxos can legally transfer assets and monies. Through combining that permission with blockchain technology, the transactions can be done rapidly, securely and with no risk. 


## Where Can You Buy Pax Dollar (USDP)?

Pax Dollar or USDP can be purchased, sold and traded on several exchanges, those being:

Bitcoin Cash,BCH,bitcoin-cash,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1831.png,coin,"## What Is Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?

[Bitcoin Cash (BCH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-bitcoin-cash) is a [peer-to-peer](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-peer-to-peer-p2p) electronic cash system that aims to become sound global money with fast payments, micro fees, privacy and larger [block size](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/block-size). As a permissionless, decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash requires no trusted third parties.

Bitcoin Cash was created as an alternative to the first and most valuable cryptocurrency — [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/). In 2017, BCH developers modified the BTC code, releasing their software version and a full-fledged competitive product, which split Bitcoin into two blockchains: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash is a result of a hard fork in the blockchain due to differences in the community over Bitcoin scaling and the SegWit upgrade. Moreover, another hard fork, which divided Bitcoin Cash into two parts, Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV, took place in the fall of 2018.

The scaling debate involved two sides: small block supporters opposed increasing block size as it could lead to blockchain centralization and vulnerability by making it harder to host full nodes. Large block supporters, however, advocated for a faster solution, concerned that rising transaction fees could hinder growth.


## Who Are the Founders of Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?

[Satoshi Nakamoto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/satoshi-nakamoto), an anonymous creator of Bitcoin, published the coin’s [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper) entitled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” in 2008. In 2009, the first Bitcoin software that powered the blockchain, went live. 

The fees were low and the transactions were reliable for several years. However, by 2016, as the popularity of Bitcoin increased, the number of transactions on its network grew, leading to slow processing times and higher fees. Mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain proposed the hard fork for increasing the block size limit to allow more transactions per block, which went live on August 1, 2017, resulting in the creation of Bitcoin Cash. It received support from some in the Bitcoin community, like Roger Ver.

Since its inception, Bitcoin Cash has experienced its own set of challenges and milestones. One notable event was another hard fork in November 2018, which led to the creation of [Bitcoin SV](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-vs-bitcoin-cash-vs-bitcoin-sv) (BSV), a separate cryptocurrency. The split was caused by disagreements within the Bitcoin Cash community regarding proposed changes to the protocol. As a result, two competing implementations emerged - Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV - with the former continuing as Bitcoin Cash and the latter becoming its own distinct cryptocurrency.


## How Does Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Work?

Due to the larger block size, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) works faster and has lower transaction fees. Furthermore, Bitcoin Cash supports [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) and ecosystem apps.

With a limited total supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin Cash is provably scarce and, like physical cash, can be easily spent. Transactions are fast, with fees typically less than a tenth of a cent. 

Bitcoin Cash has various use cases. In addition to peer-to-peer payments between individuals, Bitcoin Cash can be used to pay participating merchants for goods and services in-store and online. Low fees enable new micro-transaction economies, such as tipping content creators and rewarding app users a few cents. Bitcoin Cash also reduces the expenses and settlement times for remittances and cross-border trade. Other use cases include tokens, simplified smart contracts, and private payments with tools such as CashShuffle and CashFusion.

## How Does Bitcoin Cash Differ From Bitcoin?

Bitcoin Cash was considered by some supporters to be the legitimate continuation of Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash. All Bitcoin holders at the time of the fork (block 478,558) automatically became owners of Bitcoin Cash.

From a technical perspective, Bitcoin Cash is similar to the Bitcoin algorithm. Namely: both projects have a hard cap of 21 million coins and also use [Proof-of-Work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoW) consensus framework and nodes to verify transactions.

Unlike Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)), Bitcoin Cash aims to scale to meet the demands of a global payment system. At the time of the split, the Bitcoin Cash block size was increased from 1MB to 8MB. An increased block size means Bitcoin Cash can now handle significantly more transactions per second (TPS) while keeping fees extremely low, solving the issues of payment delays and high fees experienced by some users on the Bitcoin BTC network.

As of 2023, Bitcoin Cash has a block size of 32MB, compared to Bitcoin’s block size of 1MB.


## How Many Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Coins Are There in Circulation?

As with Bitcoin, the maximum supply of Bitcoin Cash has a hard cap of 21 million coins. The circulating supply as of May 2023 is 19,387,119 BCH.


## How Is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Secured?

As with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is secured by a [Proof-of-Work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoW) consensus mechanism, where miners solve computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. 


### How Do You Mine Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?

[Mining](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mining) is the process in which new Bitcoin Cash transactions are confirmed, and new blocks are added to the blockchain. Miners use computing power and electricity to solve complex puzzles. By doing so, they can produce new blocks of transactions. If one of their blocks is accepted by the network, the miner, or mining pool, earns a [block reward](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/block-reward) in the form of newly-issued Bitcoin Cash.

Mining is highly competitive. As the price of Bitcoin Cash in the marketplace rises, more miners are incentivized to bring more [hash rate](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hash-power-hash-rate) into the ever-increasing miner competition to produce and accept blocks by the Bitcoin Cash network. More miners make the blockchain more secure by increasing and distributing the hash rate. This prevents a single miner from having control over the web.


## Where Can You Buy Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?

If you would like to know where to buy BCH at the current rate, the top cryptocurrency exchanges for trading in BCH are [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/), [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/), [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/) and more.

Algorand,ALGO,algorand,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/4030.png,coin,"## What Is Algorand (ALGO)?

Algorand is a self-sustaining, [decentralized](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized), [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based network that supports a wide range of applications. These systems are secure, scalable and efficient, all critical properties for effective applications in the real world. Algorand will support computations that require reliable performance guarantees to create new forms of trust.

The Algorand [mainnet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mainnet) became live in June 2019, and was able to handle almost 1 million transactions per day as of December 2020. Algorand transaction metrics can be viewed [here](https://metrics.algorand.org/). Algorand [initial coin offering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) (ICO) was held in June 2019, with the Algorand price of $2.4 per token.


### Who Are the Founders of Algorand?

Silvio Micali is a professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the founder of Algorand. He is a recipient of the Turing Award (in 2012) for his fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of secure two-party computation, electronic cash, cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols. This makes him one of the foremost creators of crypto in the world.


#### What Makes Algorand Unique?

Algorand was invented to speed up transactions and improve efficiency, in response to the slow transaction times of Bitcoin and other blockchains. Algorand is designed so that there are lower [transaction fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/transaction-fee), as well as no mining (like [Bitcoin's](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) energy-intensive process), as it is based on a permissionless pure [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) (PoS) blockchain protocol.

### Algorand’s Compatibility with Ethereum

On Feb. 17, 2022, the Algorand Foundation announced a $10M grant to Applied Blockchain to develop the London Bridge, a trustless [bridge](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bridges) that will bring [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) compatibility to the Algorand blockchain. Algorand has struggled to attract [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) to its ecosystem, despite promising low cost transactions, low latency and high scalability. Having a bridge to Ethereum, which currently has the most robust [DApp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) ecosystem, would allow Algorand to connect to these applications and attract more liquidity. In the long-term, the Algorand Foundation aims to have verification of other chains be performed on Alogrand’s [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), by incorporating state proofs in the form of Compact Certificates into the Algorand Consensus. The foundation’s goal is to eventually solidify the [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) ecosystem on Algorand.

## Algorand Staking Mechanism: Pure Proof-of-Stake

Algorand employs a kind of [Proof-of-Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) known as [Pure Proof-of-Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/pure-proof-of-stake-ppos) ([PPoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/pure-proof-of-stake-ppos)). PPoS is a highly democratized PoS consensus method with a minimal staking requirement for network participation and security: only one ALGO token is required to join. In comparison, Ethereum 2.0 needs a minimum stake of 32 ether (ETH), a substantially higher barrier to entry for consumers. 

A low minimum staking requirement, on the other hand, may have a negative impact on network security since network users may be less inclined to behave properly when they do not have a significant value staked in the network.


## Production of Algorand Blocks Through PPoS

Validator nodes are chosen at random in Pure Proof-of-Stake networks to confirm the transaction data in a block. The Algorand PPoS consensus method employs a two-phase block manufacturing procedure that includes proposing and voting. 

By [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) ALGO and establishing a valid participation key, every member of the Algorand network can participate in the proposing and voting procedure. A [relay node](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/relay-nodes) is a form of Algorand network node that facilitates communication among [participation nodes](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/participation-node) but does not actively engage in proposing or voting.


## Algorand’s Native Cryptocurrency: ALGO

ALGO is the native coin of Algorand and a key component of its network topology. The benefits provided to validators for creating blocks are divided and dispersed among all coin holders, rather than being awarded just to [block producers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/block-producer), as part of Algorand's unique protocol architecture. 

The distribution of rewards occurs around every 10 minutes. It is meant to encourage people to join the Algorand staking platform and smoothen the route to decentralization.

To make things easier, users are not required to lock their coins as part of the block manufacturing and validation process. If they want to earn incentives, they may simply keep ALGO its official [non-custodial](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-custodial) wallet, named MyAlgo Wallet. In this regard, Algorand has reached near automation, since stakeholders can hold ALGO while also supporting the network.

#### How Many Algorand (ALGO) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The genesis of the Algorand blockchain states that 10 billion ALGO was minted. The distribution of the fixed and immutable 10 billion ALGO will end in 2030, rather than the initial plan of 2024. For more information about Algorand’s tokenomics, see [here](https://algorand.foundation/the-algo/algo-dynamics).


### How Is the Algorand Network Secured?

The Algorand blockchain is a permissionless pure [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) blockchain protocol. Unlike [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow) (PoW) blockchains, where the root block must be validated by randomly-selected validators (using computing power), in the pure proof-of-stake approach all of the validators are known to one another and only have to agree on the next block in order to create a new block.


### Where Can You Buy Algorand (ALGO)?

Algorand can be bought on the following exchanges:

[Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/)

[Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)

[OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/)

Render,RNDR,render,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5690.png,token,"## What is RNDR?
[RenderToken](https://rendertoken.com/) (RNDR) is a distributed GPU rendering network built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to connect artists and studios in need of GPU compute power with mining partners willing to rent their GPU capabilities out. Conceived in 2009 by OTOY, inc. CEO Jules Urbach and launched in 2017, RNDR held its first public token sale in October of that same year, followed by a private sale period lasting from January 2018 – May 2018, wherein a total of 117,843,239 RNDR were sold at a price of 1 RNDR = $0.25 USD equivalent of token. 
During the private sale period, early adopters were onboarded onto the RNDR Beta Testnet, where beta node operators and artists worked collaboratively with the RNDR team in building and testing the network, up until its public launch on April 27th 2020. 

## How does RNDR work
RNDR is an ERC-20 utility token used by artists on the network to exchange for GPU compute power from GPU providers (node operators). RNDR utilizes a combination manual and automatic proof of work system, or in this case proof of render, in order to verify all art has been successfully rendered prior to payment disbursal and art release. Utilizing the inherent security properties of the Ethereum blockchain, proprietary assets are hashed upon upload and sent to nodes piecemeal for rendering. All RNDR payments are stored in escrow during rendering, and are released to node operators upon manual verification by the commissioning artist of successful work. To prevent malicious actors in both user bases, all assets rendered on the network are watermarked until payment is successfully disbursed, upon which time un-watermarked renderings may be downloaded, and all payment is held in escrow until manually verified as being correctly rendered. 

## About RNDR
Backed by parent company OTOY, the RNDR team is based out of Los Angeles, with team members throughout the world. The [RNDR advisory board](https://rendertoken.com/#team) boasts industry leaders such as Ari Emanuel (Co-Founder and Co-CEO, WME), JJ Abrams (Chairman and CEO, Bad Robot Productions) and Brendan Eich (Founder and CEO, Brave Software and BAT), who have all advised RNDR in various capacities in bridging the gap between creating a system that appeals to both cryptocurrency communities and Hollywood studio production pipelines.

XDC Network,XDC,xdc-network,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2634.png,coin,"## What Is XDC Network (XDC)?

XDC Network (formerly known as XinFin Network) is a hybrid (public / [private](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/private-blockchain)) [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) platform that combines the transparency of [public blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/public-blockchain) with the speed and security of private networks. With the help of blockchain technology and state-of-the-art infrastructure, the project intends to provide streamlined financial services to its users.

The protocol’s open-source software uses a [delegated-Proof-of-Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos) (XDPoS) consensus mechanism, which facilitates fast transactions, interoperability, and cybersecurity. The network can process 2000 [transactions per second](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/transactions-per-second) (TPS), and thanks to interoperable [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) and [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) (EVM) compatibility, users can more easily scale their projects.


## Who Are the Founders of XDC Network?

XinFin was founded in 2017 and is based in Singapore. The platform's founders are Ritesh Kakkad, Atul Khekade and Karan Bhardwaj. In 2018, however, Bhardwaj resigned to devote more time to his own startup, Elatior Tech.

Ritesh Kakkad is a tech entrepreneur with extensive experience in the blockchain industry. He earned his bachelor's degree in commerce, accounting, and finance from the University of Mumbai in India. Before joining XinFin, he helped establish the solutions and application development firm IndSoft Systems. 

Atul Khekade is a skilled computer engineer and programmer who establishes new technology companies and provides funding for emerging platforms on XDC. He was instrumental in the development of MonetaGo, a financial technology firm that works to combat online fraud. On top of that, he was instrumental in the development of Airnetz, a hybrid online-offline travel agency. He graduated from India's Sardar Patel College of Engineering with a degree in IT.


## What Makes XDC Network (XDC) Unique?

The XDC Network is an [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible, [layer 1 blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) that is compatible with the global payment messaging standard, ISO 20022, making it a convenient platform onto which developers and financial institutions can build applications. Additionally, the platform launched the XDCPay app: a web extension with support for some popular browsers, which claims to simplify the user experience for investors and businesses.

XDC wants to address the challenges that early blockchain networks failed to address: low network bandwidth, unreasonably high fees and a poor experience for developers. The platform also supports [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), so developers have the option of building apps and protocols on the blockchain.

It allows for the deployment of [layer 2](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) digital assets (via Origin), and employs sharding to process transactions faster (over 2000 transactions per second).

The platform is an open-source hybrid blockchain for global trade and finance. Thanks to its hybrid design, XDC interacts with both public and private blockchains. The system provides hybrid relay bridges that retransmit transactions into the public network.

They can stake their tokens and receive XDC rewards in exchange for processing transactions and contributing to the network’s security. Decentralized applications, or [dApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps), developed on the platform use XDC as a utility token as well.

XDC has a total supply of 37,705,012,699 coins and a circulating supply of 13,828,679,553 coins, as of April 2023. The token distribution is as follows: rewards for network participants (32.5%); team (25%); ecosystem (15%); hedge pool (10%); pre-placement and token offering (10%); charities (5%); reserves (2.5%).


## How Is the XDC Network Secured?

XDC Network (XDC) is secured through an environmentally friendly and highly efficient [dPoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos) consensus algorithm known as XinFin delegated Proof-of-Stake (XDPoS). It’s more advanced and secure than other algorithms, as it leverages the node mechanism and produces blocks more efficiently. The algorithm also features a self-KYC feature, and has [KYC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/kyc) implementation on the nodes.

Populous,PPT,populous,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1789.png,token,"## What Is Populous (PPT)?

Populous is a network designed to offer small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) invoice liquidity for up to 90 days. Launched in 2017, Populous is designed to enable peer-to-peer ([P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p)) interaction between enterprises, boost liquidity and solve problems with working capital for SMEs.

By relying on [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) technology and smart contracts, the Populous network facilitates decentralized communication between businesses and allows them to share liquidity pools. According to the network’s official [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.io/document/19/populous-whitepaper), there is a need for liquidity in the sector, and Populous is trying to bring the solution. By providing short-term liquidity to enterprises through P2P lending, the network gives enterprises quick access to capital, which cannot be achieved by waiting for customers to settle invoices. 


### Who Are the Founders of Populous?

Populous was founded by two twin brothers from south London [Steve](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-nico-williams/?originalSubdomain=uk) and [Sam Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samenricowilliams/). 

Steve Williams graduated in philosophy from London Metropolitan University, and since November 2016, he is the acting CEO of Populous. Sam Williams turned to other business ventures, founding The Trend View and Zloadr.


#### What Makes Populous Unique?

Populous aims to innovate the way liquidity is handled in small and medium enterprises. By introducing blockchain technology and smart contracts, the platform allows peer-to-peer interaction between businesses, lenders and invoice settlers. This means that the completely decentralized system charges significantly lower fees on liquidity loans and does not use intermediaries to facilitate the connection between lenders and borrowers.

Invoice selling is a relatively new financial tool that allows businesses to get loans on their outstanding invoices to use the underlying capital even if the customer has not yet paid the invoice. Populous transfers the process of lending money backed by invoices onto the blockchain, making it more scalable, faster, and easier for enterprises to use. The network has attracted funding from big firms, such as Fireblue Capital.

Filecoin,FIL,filecoin,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2280.png,coin,"To find out even more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Filecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/).

## What Is Filecoin (FIL)?

Filecoin is a decentralized storage system that aims to “store humanity’s most important information.” The project raised $205 million in an [initial coin offering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) (ICO) in 2017, and initially planned a launch date for mid-2019. However, the launch date for the Filecoin mainnet was pushed back until block 148,888, which is expected in mid-October 2020.

The project was first described back in 2014 as an incentive layer for the [Interplanetary File System](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) (IPFS), a peer-to-peer storage network where users pay for data storage and distribution services in $FIL. Filecoin is open protocol and backed by a blockchain that records commitments made by the network’s participants, with transactions made using FIL, the blockchain’s native currency. The blockchain is based on both [proof-of-replication](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-replication) and [proof-of-spacetime](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-spacetime).

Filecoin is open-source and decentralized, which means that all governance is in the hands of the community. On the Filecoin platform, developers have the opportunity to create cloud file storage services like Dropbox or iCloud. Anyone can join Filecoin and start storing their data or earn money by providing space for someone else's funds. The creators of Filecoin opted for their blockchain technology to run the network and their token with their own consensus.

$FIL is the native currency of Filecoin that powers the entire network and all processes. Clients pay for transactions in FIL tokens. Miners place FIL as collateral, guaranteeing their services.

The developers claim that Filecoin solves the problem of inefficient file storage and retrieval. Customers can find the right solution with an efficient set of tools and its core development, IPFS. 

### Who Are the Founders of Filecoin?

Filecoin was founded by Juan Benet, who also created the Interplanetary File System. Benet is an American computer scientist who studied at Stanford University. After founding Protocol Labs in May 2014, he attended Y Combinator in the summer of 2014 with the intention of supporting both IPFS and Filecoin, as well as other projects.

### What Makes Filecoin Unique?

Filecoin aims to store data in a decentralized manner. Unlike cloud storage companies like Amazon Web Services or Cloudflare, which are prone to the problems of centralization, Filecoin leverages its decentralized nature to protect the integrity of a data’s location, making it easily retrievable and hard to censor. 

Decentralized storage systems like Filecoin allow people to be their own custodians of their data, as well as makes the web more accessible to people worldwide. Since participating in the Filecoin network by mining and storing is directly related to winning more block rewards, Filecoin incentives participants to act honestly and store as much data as possible.

### How Does Filecoin Work?

There are three parties involved in the Filecoin system: clients, storage miners, and retrieval miners. These groups of users interact closely with each other, concluding transactions, exchanging information, and making micropayments in $FIL.

Clients pay for storing or retrieving data. They place an order on the online storage market, where a deal is subsequently concluded with storage miners. Storage miners, in turn, store client’s data and receive rewards. This group of users places files in free sectors of a hard drive, all actions are recorded in the blockchain, and clients receive private keys. 

Retrieval miners extract data at a request of a client. Clients place a trade on the off-chain Retrieval Market. Retrieval miners can also act as storage miners. 

Filecoin is based on IPFS where all data is stored on a peer-to-peer blockchain. To start the process, users choose miners to store personal data and pay for placement in FIL tokens. Thereby, miners execute trades, and receive participation fees and FIL rewards. The more storage miners offer, the higher the chances of getting rewarded. At any time, clients can check how their data is stored during a transaction, as proofs are fixed in the blockchain. The Filecoin network uses the Proof-of-Replication (PoRep), while the miners use the Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt).

Therefore, if a client wants to hopefully keep their data safe on the Filecoin network, then they must pay the miner. The cost is set by the open market, and the price is made up of several factors. In the open market, there is hyper competition among miners, where everyone puts forward their own minimum price for storage.


### Benefits of Filecoin

Firstly, with the launch of a large and free market specializing in data storage, there is a tendency to reduce the cost of the service itself. The market becomes more open to everyone, which gives a lower price for using the network.

As of September 2022, the network has united over 20,000 users and computers around the world, creating an extensive community with similar goals and requests. Moreover, Filecoin opts for existing resources, instead of creating new technologies and devices. Miners can join the network from anywhere in the world.

Finally, Filecoin is a decentralized network with its own ways of protecting information and preventing single-point attacks.

#### How Many Filecoin (FIL) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Protocol Labs [describes](https://filecoin.io/blog/introducing-the-filecoin-economy/) Filecoin’s tokenomics, or economic model, as a “market for data” where users can sell their storage space to other users, who are looking to rent. Five stakeholders will be able to trade tokens: developers, clients, miners, token holders and ecosystem partners. There will also be three Filecoin markets, according to Protocol Labs: file storage, file retrieval and on-exchange token trading. 

In fall 2020, 400 miners participated in what was called the “Space Race” testnet phase, increasing Filecoin’s network data capacity by over 325 pebibytes; approximately 3.5 million FIL tokens will be released to the Space Race participants.


### How Is the Filecoin Network Secured?

Filecoin is secured through proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime. In the Filecoin network, nodes that are also known as retrieval miners are in competition to serve clients with data as quickly as they can. They are then rewarded with FIL fees, which encourages a network of nodes that want to replicate and preserve files. 

Storage miner nodes are constantly competing for contracts to provide storage to clients to a specific length of time. When a storage miner and their client agree on a deal, the storage miner holds the client’s data in a sector and “seals” it to create a unique copy of that sector’s data. Storage miners are rewarded with FIL by clients as deal fees, and these miners can also mine blocks and receive a block reward.


### Where Can You Buy Filecoin (FIL)?

Ahead of the Filecoin mainnet launch, [Gemini](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gemini/) and [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/) have announced support for FIL. [Huobi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) will list FIL after the mainnet goes live.

Cronos,CRO,cronos,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3635.png,token,"## What Is Cronos [CRO]?

Cronos (CRO) is the native cryptocurrency token of Cronos Chain — a decentralized, open-source [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) developed by the Crypto.com payment, trading and financial services company.

Cronos Chain is one of the products in Crypto.com’s lineup of solutions designed to accelerate the global adoption of cryptocurrencies as a means of increasing personal control over money, safeguarding user data and protecting users’ identities. The CRO blockchain serves primarily as a vehicle that powers the Crypto.com Pay mobile payments app.

In the future, Crypto.com plans to expand the reach of the CRO platform to power its other products as well.

CRO went live in November-December 2018.


## Who Are the Founders of Cronos?

Cronos was launched by the Crypto.com company as part of its vision of “putting cryptocurrency in every wallet.” Crypto.com itself was founded in June 2016 as “Monaco Technologies GmbH” by Kris Marszalek, Rafael Melo, Gary Or and Bobby Bao.

Kris Marszalek, an alum of the Polish Adam Mickiewicz University, has founded and headed three companies prior to starting Crypto.com: consumer electronics design and manufacturing business Starline Polska, location-based service mobile app and platform YIYI and the e-commerce firm BEECRAZY.

Rafael Melo earned his bachelor’s degree in engineering from the PUC-Rio. Over his more than 15-year-long career in finance, Melo has worked with major companies in Asia and helped secure over 50 million AUD in funding for the Ensogo social commerce website.

Gary Or is a software engineer with over nine years of fullstack engineering experience. Prior to co-founding Crypto.com, Or worked as platform architect at Ensogo and co-founded the mobile app development firm Foris. He received his bachelor’s degree in engineering, computer science from the University of Hong Kong.

Before helping launch Crypto.com, Bobby Bao worked in the M&A department of the China Renaissance investment bank. Bao has studied at the University of Melbourne, NYU Stern School of Business and the College of William & Mary.


## What Makes Cronos Unique?

CRO blockchain is mainly focused on providing utility to the users of Crypto.com’s payment, trading and financial services solutions.

CRO owners can stake their coins on the Crypto.com Chain to act as a validator and earn fees for processing transactions on the network. Additionally, CRO coins can be used to settle transaction fees on the Cronos Chain.

Within the framework of the Crypto.com Pay payments app, users can get cashback of up to 20% by paying merchants in CRO and up to 10% by purchasing gift cards and making peer-to-peer transfers to other users.

When it comes to trading use cases, the Crypto.com App allows users to earn token rewards for select listings by [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) CRO.

Additionally, users can earn annual interest of up to 10-12% on their Crypto.com Coins by staking them on either the Crypto.com Exchange app or Crypto.com’s metal Visa Card.

Overall, CRO acts as an instrument that powers Crypto.com’s drive to increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies on a global scale. As such, the company is continuously working on finding and developing new use cases that will allow users to leverage the cryptocurrency to enhance the control they have over their money, data and identities.

## Cronos Chain

Cronos Chain, an [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)-compatible blockchain, was recently launched to run in parallel to Crypto.org blockchain. This is comparable to Binance Chain and [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain) (EVM-compatible). Cronos Chain’s mainnet beta went live on Nov. 8, 2021, and is built on the Cosmos SDK, utilizing a [proof-of-authority](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-authority-poa) (PoA) [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism). [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) (EVM) compatibility means that the thousands of [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) built on Ethereum can be ported on to the Cronos Chain. Furthermore, it also supports the Inter Blockchain Communications (IBC) protocol, which allows it to bridge to the [Cosmos](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/) ecosystem of DApps. 

Despite the recent launch, growth in [total value locked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl) (TVL) has skyrocketed, reaching a [high of over US$2B](https://defillama.com/chain/Cronos) in less than 3 months. This could be partly attributed to the [Particle B $100M CRO EVM fund](https://blog.crypto.com/particle-b-accelerator-launches-the-cro-evm-fund/), which incentivizes developers to build on Cronos. $CRO token prices also rallied by over 350% since the launch, reaching a high of $0.96. Bridge between Ethereum and Cosmos is expected to come in the near future.

## Cronos Galileo update

On January 18, 2023, the Cronos team announced that its latest mainnet upgrade, “Galileo” (version 1.0), had been completed. The upgrade marks the blockchain’s transition out of beta, having handled more than 65 million transactions for more than 1 million users without downtime.

Cronos v1.0 introduces four main improvements:

* Prioritization of mempool to further scale the transaction throughput;
* Optimized node storage, with 30% less storage for full nodes;
* Generalized reduction of node start-up time by approximately 50% plus other node performance improvements;
* New Cosmos features geared towards improved EVM/Cosmos interoperability (IBC incentivization, IBC token transfer memo field).

## Expanded Utility of Cronos (CRO) 

Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com continues to maintain that Cronos (CRO) (formerly called Crypto.com Coin) remains one of their major contributions to pushing blockchain and [Web 3.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-web-3-0) forward. 

Crypto.com launched Cronos Chain as an [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm)-compatible [sidechain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/side-chain) of its flagship Crypto.org Chain. Both chains, as well as the exchange, utilize CRO tokens for various uses.


## How Cronos Chain Has Given CRO a Leg Up? 

Cronos Chain hosts various [decentralized applications](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) ([dApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) and has a [total value locked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl) ([TVL](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl)) of over $781.86 million, at the time of writing, making it one of the largest EVM-compatible chains. It is the first blockchain that enables interoperability between the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. 

Some of the Cronos Chain dApps driving the adoption of CRO by using it as the main payment method for transactions include VVS Finance, Tectonic Finance, Ferro Protocol, MM Finance and Single Finance. 


## Cronos Chain Roadmap Progress Will See CRO Utility Advance Further 

Cronos Chain has an ambitious [roadmap for 2022](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-chain-journey-so-far-and-2022-roadmap-3475abbe6254) from which it has ticked off several achievements made in Q1 and Q2 of the year. One such item is the launch of the Cronos Chain Ambassador Program [(CROnauts)](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/introducing-the-cronos-chain-ambassador-program-cronauts-930d26449fe4) to reward active community members. 

The launch of the fourth round of the Cronos Ecosystem Grant was also [announced](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/announcing-batch-4-of-cronos-ecosystem-grants-57f7fa0f3783) in August. Five new projects including Cobo, DeFi.Watch, Robo Vault, Chainstack and Grindery have received grants to develop their dApps after participating in the Cronos Chain Hackathon. 

Meanwhile, at the time of writing, items still left on the [roadmap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/roadmap) for Q4 include the introduction of protocol [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance), interchain accounts and the introduction of EVM packets over IBC. 


## Crypto.com's Contributions to CRO 

The exchange-backed blockchains have not been the only contributors to the adoption of CRO. The increase in activities on Crypto.com during 2021-2022 has given CRO adoption a significant boost.

In 2021, Crypto.com [announced](https://crypto.com/company-news/crypto-com-2021-highlights-the-year-crypto-went-mainstream) its big token burn and permanently removed 70 billion CRO tokens from circulation. The exchange also forged multiple partnerships in a drive to get crypto to up to 1 billion users.

## How Many Cronos [CRO] Coins Are There in Circulation?

The total supply of CRO is limited to 30 billion coins (following 70 billion CRO burned in 2021), all of which were created when the blockchain went live — making it a non-mineable cryptocurrency.

The total supply of CRO will be allocated for five different purposes:



*   30% — Secondary distribution and launch incentives - released in batches on a daily basis over five years from November 14, 2018;
*   20% — Capital reserve - frozen until Nov, 7, 2022;
*   20% — Network Long-Term Incentives - frozen until Nov. 7, 2022;
*   20% — Ecosystem grants - frozen until the launch of Crypto.com Chain Mainnet;
*   10% — Community development.


## How Is the Crypto.com Coin Network Secured?

CRO is built on top of Ethereum’s ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) blockchain according to the [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) compatibility standard, which means that its network is secured by the Ethash function.

MAGA TRUMP is going to create a ""maximally curious"" AI instead of programming morality into it. This approach distinguishes it from other DeFi cryptocurrency projects and enables it to set itself apart.

MAGA is powered by 3 AI technologies namely Maga Draw, Maga GPT and Maga Scanner.

MAGA Draw:

Maga Draw is an innovative text-to-image diffusion model that allows users to create photorealistic images quickly and easily using only a text input. This empowering technology gives billions of people the potential to quickly create beautiful works of art without limits, offering endless creative freedom.

MAGA GPT:

MAGA AI is powered by GPT-4 language models that can be triggered to execute natural language processes with the assistance of accurately constructed text prompts. However, these models can create outcomes that are false, toxic, or reflect bad sentiments. This is due to the fact that GPT-4 is trained to guess the subsequent word in a vast collection of online text rather than to secure the language task that the user wishes.

MAGA Scanner

Adopting a step-by-step approach to creating such a detector, including collecting data, training a machine learning model, to improve performance.

Depending on the size and complexity of the data, we employ a range of algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Additionally, we preprocess the data by standardizing it, dealing with missing values, etc.

Curve DAO Token,CRV,curve-dao-token,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/6538.png,token,"## What Is Curve (CRV)?

Curve is a decentralized exchange for [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) that uses an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) to manage [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity).

Launched in January 2020, Curve is now synonymous with the decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) phenomenon, and has seen significant growth in the second half of 2020.

In August, Curve launched a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](DAO)), with CRV as its in-house token. The DAO uses [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)-based creation tool Aragon to connect multiple [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) used for users’ deposited liquidity. Issues such as governance, however, differ from Aragon in their weighting and other respects.


### Who Are the Founders of Curve?

The founder and CEO of Curve is Michael Egorov, a Russian scientist who has various experience with cryptocurrency-related enterprises.

In 2015, he co-founded and became CTO of NuCypher, a cryptocurrency business building privacy-preserving infrastructure and protocols.

Egorov is also the founder of decentralized bank and loans network LoanCoin.

Curve’s regular team is part of the CRV allocation structure, and will receive tokens according to a two-year vesting schedule as part of the initial launch plan. 

In August 2020, Egorov said that he “overreacted” by locking up a large amount of CRV tokens as a response to [yearn.finance’s](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/09/02/inside-ethereums-testnet-headwinds-growth-in-tokenized-bitcoin-a-data-perspective-by-intotheblock-2/) voting power, awarding himself 71% of governance in the process.


#### What Makes Curve Unique?

Curve has gained considerable attention by following its remit as an AMM specifically for stablecoin trading.

The launch of the DAO and CRV token brought in further profitability, given CRV’s use for governance, as it is awarded to users based on liquidity commitment and length of ownership.

The explosion in DeFi trading has ensured Curve’s longevity, with AMMs turning over huge amounts of liquidity and associated user profits. 

As such, Curve caters to anyone involved in DeFi activities such as [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming) and liquidity mining, as well as those looking to maximize returns without risk by holding notionally non-volatile stablecoins.

The platform makes money by charging a modest fee which is paid to liquidity providers.

#### How Many Curve (CRV) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Curve (CRV) launched in August 2020, along with the Curve DAO. Its purpose is to function as a governance medium, incentive structure and fee payment method, along with long-term earnings method for liquidity providers.

The total CRV supply is 3.03 billion tokens, the majority of which (62%) are distributed to liquidity providers. The remainder is divided as follows: 30% to shareholders, 3% to employees and 5% to a community reserve. The shareholder and employee allocations come with a two-year vesting schedule.

CRV had no premine, and the gradual unlocking of tokens means that around 750 million should be in circulation one year after launch.


### How Is the Curve Network Secured?

Curve carries the standard risks associated with depositing funds in smart contracts and dealing with AMMs, namely [impermanent loss](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss).

As Curve only supports stablecoins, the risk of markets moving too quickly is reduced, but users can still lose money once markets are rebalanced to reflect cross-market prices.

Curve has been audited, but this does not do anything to counter the risks involved in being exposed to a specific cryptocurrency.


### Where Can You Buy Curve (CRV)?

CRV is a freely-tradable token and is available against cryptocurrency, stablecoin and fiat currency pairs on major exchanges.

These include [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) and [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), which hold the lion’s share of trading volume as of September 2020.

Internet Computer,ICP,internet-computer,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/8916.png,token,"# What is the Internet Computer and ICP?

The Internet Computer blockchain incorporates a radical rethink of blockchain design, powered by innovations in cryptography. It provides the first “World Computer” blockchain that can be used to build almost any online system or service, including demanding web social media, without need for traditional IT such as cloud computing services. As such it can enable full end-to-end decentralization.

## A Web3 enabler

Imagine creating a group chat to organize your next vacation with friends, playing a social game, or interacting with photos and videos uploaded by your crush – social networks are now part of everyday life. However, they pose numerous privacy issues for users, share sensitive information with corporations, and often overwhelm users with advertisements. When you sign-up, you are asked to agree to general terms and conditions, but you cannot influence how your data is used, or what features the services provide.

Web3 has the potential to fundamentally update this old formula. A true World Computer can be used to build anything in a totally decentralized way, including demanding services like social networks. Whereas before blockchains could only be used to build web3 services in conjunction with traditional IT, such as cloud computing services, a World Computer blockchain makes it possible to build services that run entirely on blockchain. This makes it possible to assign control of these services to community DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations). These play the role of digital democracies in cypherspace that mediate the wishes of their online communities regarding economic matters, and how to update and configure the services. 

In this new formula, users are becoming both owners of web3 services and also part of the team that runs them – for example by referring other users, to drive viral growth, or helping with important  tasks such as content moderation. Because web3 services running on the blockchain under the control of a DAO are fully decentralized, just like a blockchain, they can also tokenize, just like a blockchain. For example, a web3 service might airdrop the DAO’s governance tokens to users that help out, or enable users to send satoshis with a chat message.

Services like this are already being built today on the Internet Computer blockchain, which has provided the World Computer capabilities and functionality necessary. The aim is to transform the entire internet ecosystem.

## World Computer Functionality

The purpose of the Internet Computer blockchain is to add World Computer functionality to the public internet. On the Internet Computer, developers can build decentralized online systems and services entirely on the blockchain, without using centralized traditional IT.

Because the Internet Computer is a blockchain, developers build online systems and services using “smart contract” software. Using smart contracts in this application can provide game-changing advantages. For example, because smart contracts are  tamperproof, just like the Bitcoin ledger, systems and services do not  have to be protected by firewalls to keep the hackers out – solving for the increasing number of hacks afflicting business and society. Another advantage is that web3 services built on the Internet Computer can process tokens, and create new economic rails. For example, web3 can combine social media and DeFi, to produce SocialFi, such as a social network that is fully tokenized. 

The Internet Computer provides “canister” smart contract functionality. These can do many new things, including serving interactive web experiences directly to users by processing HTTP requests, creating transactions that directly run on other blockchains using “Chain Key TX”, scaling without limit, and running with efficiency comparable to traditional IT, greatly reducing the harmful CO2 emissions caused by blockchain, and one day, the tech ecosystem generally.

Web3 developers can build DeFi, SocialFi, GameFi and metaverse services. They can process tokens on other blockchains, without bridges, using Chain Key TX. And they can full decentralize systems such as DeFi on Ethereum, by using the Internet Computer to create the interactive web experience, in place of centralized traditional IT, such as cloud computing services.

On the Internet Computer, canister smart contracts uniquely pay for their own computation using a “reverse gas” model. This means web3 users can create sessions with services, which can submit vast numbers of blockchain transactions, such as sending chat messages in a conversation, without requiring additional interaction from the user.

The Internet Computer supports a new blockchain authentication system called Internet Identity. This allows users to use their devices as cryptographic passwords, signing in to online services using the fingerprint sensor on their laptop or Face ID on their phone, as well as traditional devices like a Ledger wallet.

Because web3 services can be built 100% on the blockchain, they can be placed under the full control of community DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), which perform all configurations and updates. Users can be made owners of online services, and part of the team that runs them.

The Internet Computer network is controlled by an advanced DAO that is integrated into its protocols, called the Network Nervous System, or NNS. This updates the replica (or “client”) software that runs  on the dedicated node machines that host the blockchain on an almost weekly basis, driving the rapid evolution of the network.

## Why Does the ICP token have value?

The ICP token has three main utilities. Firstly, ICP provides a source of “cycles” that are burned to power computation (thus when ICP is converted to cycles, it disappears, creating deflationary pressure). Secondly, ICP can be staked in the permissionless Network Nervous System DAO that governs the Internet Computer blockchain, creating voting neurons that generate voting rewards. Thirdly, ICP plays the role of a store of value, for example allowing users to invest in decentralization sales run by web3 services.

## How Does the Internet Computer Work?

The internet, which now connects nearly everybody and everything, runs on a network of special devices called routers. Some, like WiFi routers, are installed in homes, while others, which connect countries, are very specialized and expensive. The Internet Computer blockchain runs on a network of special computing devices called “node machines,” which are built to a variety of standards.

Today, most Proof-of-Stake blockchains are hosted by “validator” nodes that are software instances often spun up on cloud computing services. The Internet Computer cannot be hosted in this way. It runs entirely on a sovereign network of dedicated node machines, which are installed in independent data centers by independent “node providers.”

These node machines connect to each other using Internet Computer Protocol, or ICP, which is where the token gets its name from. The best moniker to describe the blockchain network model used by the Internet Computer is “Proof-of-Useful-Work”. The network has a governance system called the NNS, which can slash (‘eject”) node machines that fail to produce enough blocks and keep up with the network, which is why they need to be built to a standard specification.

Internally, the Internet Computer network is composed of “subnet blockchains.” Each new subnet adds additional capacity to the network, which means it can host more smart contracts, computation and data. However, these subnets are invisible to the hosted smart contracts and users. This is because they are combined into a single logical blockchain using “chain key crypto.”

Chain key crypto is unique to the Internet Computer. It enables subnet blockchains, and the overall Internet Computer blockchain produced, to have public “chain keys”. The blockchains cryptographically sign all their interactions, which can be validated using their chain keys. Valid signatures show that interactions have not been tampered with, and also that the blockchains are running correctly – without any need to download and check their blocks of transactions. 

Thanks to chain key crypto, the Internet Computer can combine its subnet blockchains into a single blockchain and scale limitlessly. However, chain key crypto also makes other things possible! For example, smart contracts on the Internet Computer can process HTTP requests and serve interactive web experiences directly to end-users. This is more secure than normal web serving because the smart contracts can sign the content they serve, which can be validated before it is shown to users, keeping them safe.

Recently, chain key crypto has been used to make “Chain Key TX” functionality available to smart contract developers. This enables them to create signed transactions that run on other blockchains. For example, an Internet Computer developer can create bitcoin addresses, and send and receive bitcoin, directly on the Bitcoin ledger, without using insecure “bridge” services. Using this functionality, native Bitcoin DeFi can be created.

The Internet Computer also provides many other features that are unique within blockchain. These include HTTP outcalls, which enable smart contracts to securely query other systems over the web, through its network consensus system, for example making it possible for smart contract software to securely obtain data such as crypto asset price feeds without using a trusted oracle service. 

The Internet Computer network is controlled and managed by a master subnet, which runs an advanced permissionless DAO called the Network Nervous System (NNS). This instructs the node machines how to structure the network. Nodes can verify that the instructions they have received from the NNS are genuine just by checking the chain key signature, since its chain key never changes.

The NNS instructs nodes to join and leave subnets, and to form new subnets. The cryptography and protocols work in a clever way, such that even though nodes come and go from subnet blockchains, their chain keys always stay the same.

On the Internet Computer, developers build using “canister” smart contracts. They are referred to as canisters, because they are bundles of WebAssembly bytecode, and persistent memory pages. The bytecode implements the logic of the smart contract, and it runs exclusively in its own memory, interacting with other smart contracts using message passing (using a software “actor” model). This makes it possible to run smart contracts in parallel, which is another way the Internet Computer scales.

Canister smart contracts are very powerful, and can be used to build anything. For example, multi-block transactions (computations) are possible, along with daemon smart contracts, which are automatically invoked periodically by the blockchain.

The main languages used for developing Internet Computer smart contracts are Rust and Motoko. Motoko is a language created by DFINITY specifically for the Internet Computer, which was developed by a team led by Andreas Rossberg, who was the co-inventor of the WebAssembly standard.

The best way to understand how the Internet Computer works, and the range of unique capabilities it provides, is to visit [internetcomputer.org](https://internetcomputer.org), and [wiki.internetcomputer.org](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org).



# Who Created the Internet Computer?

The Internet Computer blockchain was developed by the [DFINITY Foundation](https://dfinity.org), headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland, which runs R&D centers in Switzerland and California, and remote teams worldwide. By mid-2022, DFINITY employed almost 300 people, primarily in R&D. The team includes many famous cryptographers, computer science researchers and engineers.

The DFINITY Foundation was founded in Switzerland in October 2016 to organize development of the Internet Computer blockchain. The name DFINITY is a shortening of “decentralized infinity,” and dates from early 2015. It was first used by project founder, Dominic Williams, to refer to his theoretical crypto work, which he hoped would make a World Computer possible.

In February 2017, the DFINITY Foundation ran an early public ICO to raise funds to scale out. This was then supplemented by private fundraising rounds in 2018, which raised money from more than 100 hedge funds and VCs, including well-known names such as Andreessen Horowitz, before the advent of a16z crypto.

IOST,IOST,iostoken,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2405.png,coin,"## What Is IOST (IOST)?

IOST describes itself as an “ultra-fast,” fully fledged and [decentralized](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized) [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) [network](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/network) and ecosystem with its own nodes, [wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/wallets) and based on the “next-generation” [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) [protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/protocol) dubbed “proof-of-believability.” 


### Who Are the Founders of IOST?

The project was launched in January 2018 by Jimmy Zhong, Terrence Wang, Justin Li, Ray Xiao, Sa Wang and Kevin Tan.

 

Zhong has founded other tech startups in the U.S. and China. After his university days, he returned to Beijing and co-founded IOST, among other projects.

Wang’s previous experience includes serving as an Uber software engineer. He holds a degree in computer science from the University of Minnesota and a masters in computer science from Princeton University.

 

Li previously worked as an investment banking associate at Goldman Sachs and a data scientist at Mobike. He graduated with a degree in applied mathematics and computer science. Meanwhile, Tan was a co-founder at Ethercap, while he received a degree in computer science from Tsinghua University.

 

Xiao co-founded Dora — alongside Jimmy and Sa — an AI company focused on intelligent kiosks. He studied computer science and quantitative economics at university.


#### What Makes IOST Unique?

IOST’s blockchain infrastructure is open-source and designed to be secure and scalable — all in the hope that it will serve as the backbone for online services in the future.

The team have developed a “proof-of-believability” [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) [algorithm](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/algorithm) to ensure [transactions](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/transaction-tx) on the network are secure and efficient.

One of the biggest challenges that IOST aims to resolve centers on how big companies may not be able to embrace blockchains in a customer-facing environment unless they are scalable. The Internet of Services Token is put forward as a way of tackling this problem.

 

To understand IOST, the best way to do it is by comparing it to its nearest competitors: [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) is the most popular smart contract platform for developers. It can also be compared to [EOS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos) and [TRON](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron), which are highly scalable smart contract platforms with high usage.

 

The largest difference between IOST and its competitors is how it claims it can process up to 100,000 transactions per second compared with Ethereum’s 20, Tron’s 2,000 and EOS’s 4,000. 

In order to reach these transaction speeds, the IOST team has created a novel blockchain architecture, which introduces and combines several innovations including a Distributed Randomness Protocol, Efficient Distributed Sharding, TransEpoch, Atomix, Proof-of-Believability and Micro State Blocks.

#### How Many IOST (IOST) Coins Are There in Circulation?

IOST has a total token supply of 21 billion. An ICO was held in January 2018 where 40% were sold, raising about $31.3 million worth of ETH at the time. 

As for the remainder, 35% has been retained by the IOST Foundation, 12.5% was allocated to building the community, 10% went to the IOST team and 2.5% was dedicated to investors and advisors.


### How Is the IOST Network Secured?

In order to compete with hundreds of niche blockchains, IOST relies heavily on its proof-of-believability protocol (PoB) and efficient distributed sharding (EDS) to improve the scalability and security of its blockchain. 

IOST is built for enterprise use, so it claims to be able to handle heavy loads produced by big tech companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook. Partnerships appear to be key for the project’s success.


### Where Can You Buy IOST (IOST)?

IOST can be bought at many exchanges such as Bittrex, CoinEx, Livecoin, Binance and Bitrue.

# What Is Oasis Network (ROSE)?
Oasis is the leading privacy-enabled and scalable layer-1 blockchain network. It combines high throughput and low gas fees with secure architecture to provide a next-generation foundation for Web3 and will power DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, Metaverse, Data tokenization and Data DAOs. 

Oasis propels web3 forward, scaling it and evolving it from infancy to maturity. Supported by top industry backers, Oasis recently announced the [$235 million Ecosystem Fund](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/the-oasis-ecosystem-fund-reaches-235-million-6a4db2cd9370)  to support projects to build on the network. Oasis Labs, the ecosystem technical contributor, has partnered with the likes of Meta, BMW Group Genetica and others, to build platforms and products that further individual privacy protection, data governance, and responsible data use. 
   
	 
## Technology

* Separates consensus and execution into two layers, the Consensus Layer and The ParaTime Layer, for better scalability and increased versatility
* Separation of consensus and execution allows multiple ParaTimes to process transactions in parallel, meaning complex workloads processed on one ParaTime won’t slow down faster, simpler transactions on another.
* Oasis Network is the only layer-1 blockchain with native support for [Rollups](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/oasis-network-architecture-designed-for-scaling-2799994a4a21) at the Consensus Layer
* The ParaTime Layer is entirely decentralized, allowing anyone to develop and build their own ParaTime. Each ParaTime can be developed in isolation to meet the needs of a specific application, such as confidential compute, open or closed committees, and more.
* The network’s sophisticated discrepancy detection makes Oasis more efficient than sharding and parachains, requiring a smaller replication factor for the same level of security.
* There are 3 ParaTimes built by the Oasis core team already on the network.
* Emerald ParaTime, the EVM Compatible ParaTime, was built to solve the problems faced by Solidity developers, i.e., high fees and low throughput. Emerald solves both of these problems by increasing the throughput of transactions to up to 1,000 per second and reducing fees by 99%+ compared to Ethereum. This means more users will be able to use and build on the network.
* Cipher ParaTime, the confidential smart contract ParaTime, will hold the features that Oasis is uniquely capable of supporting - privacy-preserving smart contracts. As with Emerald, it boasts high throughput, instant finality, and low fees with added privacy-preserving features. Cipher enables DEX’s to stop front-running transactions, NFT users to protect their assets privately, and can potentially unlock trillions in credit and lending markets from traditional finance.
* Sapphire ParaTime is the confidential EVM ParaTime and the first confidential EVM runtime in the industry. At Oasis, we have recognised the importance of privacy technology. We want to empower developers to build privacy-enabled applications to be a part of, and to propel, Web3 forward. Much like Emerald, we want to empower solidarity developers to be comfortable building on the Oasis Network. That is why Sapphire is an EVM-compatible environment. However, we also want these developers to move forward in the rapidly expanding Web3 world by supplying our privacy-protecting technology in a familiar environment.
* Parcel ParaTime, the confidential data storage, governance, and compute ParaTime, Parcel already has enterprise partners like Nebula Genomics, Genetica, and BMW, using it to store private data like human genomic data. Parcel enables governance, confidential computation, and private analysis of data. Applications developers can use the Parcel SDK to integrate privacy-preserving data storage, governance, and computation into their applications. Parcel is also the data tokenization engine that can turn any data into an NFT. We envisage this functionality to enable people to take back control of the data they create, turning it into assets they can stake and earn rewards, thus creating a new responsible data economy.


## Team

The Oasis Team is made up of top talent, from around the world, with backgrounds from Apple, Google, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, Harvard, and more. The majority of the core engineering team are PHD level educated and all committed to growing and expanding the impact of the Oasis Network.  The project has strong roots in academia; Dawn Song, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the world’s foremost experts in computer security and trustworthy artificial intelligence is the Founder of Oasis Labs, which is an active member of the Oasis Ecosystem and one of the early contributors to the Oasis technology. Moreover, the project is backed by  top VC firms and investors,  including, Andreessen Horowitz, Accel, Binance Labs, Polychain, Pantera, and many others.


## What Makes Oasis Network Unique?

**Scalability:** 

The Oasis Network is multi-layered, making it highly flexible, scalable, and future-proof. The modular architecture separates consensus and smart contract execution into different layers allowing developers to deploy low-cost privacy-focused dApps. 

The ParaTime Layer, a layer which allows for dynamic compute environments to be built, is where all smart contract execution happens, enabling incredible scalability for the network. ParaTimes can also evolve independently while maintaining consensus as security, scalability, or privacy technologies advance into the future.

**Privacy-Enabled: **

The Oasis Network is the world’s leading scalable, privacy-enabled blockchain with its ParaTime layer enabling customizable confidentiality for developers. ParaTimes on the Oasis Network then leverage its privacy-preserving technology, enabling users to have complete control over the confidentiality of their information. 

With the Cipher ParaTime, developers can experience a proper Web3 environment that is privacy-first and geared towards confidentiality. Cipher supports the building of complex confidential smart contracts, opening up a world of opportunities for users who want to be in charge of their data.
Sapphire is another privacy-enabled ParaTime that is the first and only confidential EVM compatible. Solidity developers now can easily switch to Web3 in an environment that is familiar with tools that are well known, and built Web3 dApps like never before.

**A Foundation for Web3:**

Oasis is working to establish itself as the foundation for the Web3 world. The core value proposition of privacy gives way to other tenants required in the next iteration of the internet. Oasis supports critical pillars like decentralized identity, decentralized society, a responsible data economy and data sovereignty through its range of privacy-preserving technologies and robust blockchain platform. 


## How Many Oasis Network (ROSE) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The current supply of [Oasis Network](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/) ROSE is 1.5 billion tokens, with a total supply of 10 billion ROSE. The token distribution is as follows:



* 23.5% – staking rewards
* 23% – backers
* 5% – strategic partners & reserve
* 18.5% – community & ecosystem
* 10% – foundation endowment
* 20% – core contributors

2.3 billion tokens will be automatically paid out as [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) rewards to stakers and delegators for securing the network over ten years. ROSE is used for transaction fees, staking and delegation at the Consensus Layer. By staking ROSE, users can secure the Oasis blockchain and earn up to 20% APY rewards. 


## How Is the Oasis Network Secured?

The consensus layer is a proof-of-stake (Pos)-secured blockchain with a decentralized set of validator nodes operated by independent nodes. The separation of execution from consensus is secured using [fraud proofs](https://medium.com/@cpbuckland88/fraud-proofs-and-virtual-machines-2826a3412099). On the Oasis Network’s Cipher ParaTime, nodes are required to use a type of secure computing technology called a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), which acts as a hypothetical black box for smart contract execution in a confidential ParaTime. Encrypted data goes into the black box along with the smart contract, data is decrypted, processed by the smart contract and then encrypted before it is sent out of the TEE. This process ensures that data remains confidential and is never leaked to the node operator or application developer.

Injective,INJ,injective,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/7226.png,token,"To find out even more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Injective Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-injective-protocol-inj-features-tokenomics-and-price-prediction).

## What Is Injective Protocol (INJ)?

Injective is a blockchain built for finance. It is an open, interoperable layer-one blockchain powering next-generation DeFi applications, including decentralized spot and derivatives exchanges, prediction markets, lending protocols and more. 

Injective uniquely provides powerful core financial infrastructure primitives that applications can leverage, including a fully decentralized MEV-resistant on-chain orderbook. In addition, all forms of financial markets such as spot, perpetual, futures and options are fully on-chain. The decentralized cross-chain bridging infrastructure is compatible with Ethereum, IBC-enabled blockchains, and non EVM chains such as Solana. 

Injective also provides a next-generation, highly interoperable smart contract platform based on CosmWasm, with advanced interchain capabilities. Injective is custom built with the Cosmos SDK and utilizes Tendermint-based Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, providing instant transaction finality with the ability to sustain lightning-fast performance (10,000+ TPS). 

The Injective ecosystem includes 100+ projects and over 150,000 community members globally. Injective is backed by a group of prominent investors such as Binance, Pantera Capital, Jump Crypto and Mark Cuban.

Injective’s core exchange module provides state-of-the-art capabilities including an advanced on-chain order book and matching engine for spot, perpetual, futures and options markets, resistance to Miner-Extractable Value (MEV) through frequent batch auction order matching, and zero gas fees for users.

Injective natively uses IBC and is highly-interoperable with multiple layer 1s, including, but not limited to, Polygon and Solana (through an upcoming Wormhole integration). It is also uniquely built to be interoperable with Ethereum, through its own decentralized ERC-20 token bridge, making Injective the first network within the Cosmos ecosystem to natively support Ethereum assets. 

Smart contracts are implemented on Injective through CosmWasm, allowing for multi-chain smart contract transactions to occur seamlessly. Injective, however, is the only blockchain that enables automatic smart contract execution. This capability serves as a powerful building block for developers to create novel use cases that would not be possible on any other chain.

The use cases intended for INJ include but are not limited to: protocol governance, dApp value capture, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) security, developer incentives and staking. Further details regarding each of these use cases can be found below:

Protocol Governance: The INJ token governs every single component of Injective, including chain upgrades. Since its mainnet launch, the Injective community has actively contributed to governance, with all proposals passing through a DAO governance vote. The comprehensive governance page is available here.

Protocol Fee Value Capture: 60% of all fees generated from dApps enter an on-chain buy-back-and-burn auction to maintain the deflationary nature of INJ. The burn auction page is available here.

Tendermint-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Security: INJ is used to secure the Injective blockchain using a proof-of-stake mechanism. Validators and delegators can both participate in staking.

Developer Incentives: 40% of fees generated by users on dApps built on Injective go directly towards incentivizing new developers building on Injective which brings an ever growing funnel of builders to Injective.

Ethereum Classic,ETC,ethereum-classic,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1321.png,coin,"## What Is Ethereum Classic (ETC)?

Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a hard fork of [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (ETH) that launched in July 2016. Its main function is as a [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) network, with the ability to host and support decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)). Its native token is ETC.

Since its launch, Ethereum Classic has sought to [differentiate itself from Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-vs-ethereum-classic), with the two networks’ technical roadmap diverging further and further from each other with time.

Ethereum Classic first set out to preserve the integrity of the existing Ethereum blockchain after a major hacking event led to the theft of 3.6 million ETH.


## Who Are the Founders of Ethereum Classic?

Ethereum Classic is in fact the legacy chain of Ethereum, and its true creators are therefore the original Ethereum developers — Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood.

A [contentious hard fork on Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-vs-ethereum-classic) occurred in July 2016, when participants disagreed over whether to revert the blockchain to cancel out the effects of a major hack. This impacted The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao)) which had raised approximately $150 million in an initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) several months earlier.

Ethereum Classic came into being as the network which did not revert the chain. Developers state that there is no “official” team attached to the project, and that its “global development community is a permissionless 'do-ocracy,' where anyone can participate.” 


## What Makes Ethereum Classic Unique?

Ethereum Classic’s main aim is to preserve the Ethereum blockchain as it originally was, without artificially countering the DAO hack.

Its appeal was first to those who disagreed with Ethereum’s response, but the legacy network has since gained a wider fan base, which include major investors such as Barry Silbert, CEO of investment firm Grayscale. 

As a voluntary organization, the developers of ETC do not aim to turn the network into a for-profit entity. Users pay transaction fees as with Ethereum, and miners collect them based on work done as per the [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoW) mining algorithm.

Unlike Ethereum, Ethereum Classic has no plans to convert to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mining algorithm, while multiple developers continue to work on future improvements such as scaling solutions. 

## How Is Ethereum Classic Different From Ethereum?

Ethereum Classic ([ETC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-vs-ethereum-classic)) and Ethereum (ETH) are two separate blockchain networks that share a common history but have since diverged in philosophy and development.

Ethereum Classic is the original version of Ethereum that was launched in 2015. It is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum Classic secures its network using a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm.

Ethereum, on the other hand, is a fork of the original Ethereum blockchain created in 2016. It emerged as a response to a hack that caused the loss of millions of dollars worth of Ether. The Ethereum community implemented a hard fork to reverse the hack and return the stolen funds to their owners. As a result, two separate blockchains, Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC), were created.

One of the main differences between Ethereum Classic and Ethereum is their approach to governance. Ethereum has a more centralized system, with a core development team that makes decisions about the platform's future. In contrast, Ethereum Classic has a more decentralized approach to governance, with decisions made by the community through a consensus process.

Another key difference between the two is their development roadmap. Ethereum is focused on transitioning from a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm to a proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm after The Merge. Ethereum Classic, on the other hand, has focused on maintaining its original PoW algorithm and staying true to its decentralized philosophy.

## Concerns About Ethereum Classic

Ethereum has grown in popularity as the more trustworthy one of the two networks, even though Ethereum Classic and Ethereum both offer [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) and compete for the same market. 

The possible scalability constraints of Ethereum Classic are one of its main worries. The network can typically support 15 [transactions per second](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/transactions-per-second) ([TPS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/transactions-per-second)), which is significantly lower than payment networks like Visa, which support more than 1,000 transactions per second. Although Ethereum Classic has undergone numerous software improvements, one of its largest problems moving ahead will continue to be the scalability of its payment systems.

## How Many Ethereum Classic (ETC) Coins Are There In Circulation?

ETC began in a very similar technical state to ETH, with the exception of how the DAO hack transactions were handled.

Since launch, however, changes in [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics) have occurred, with participants voting to cap the supply of ETC in December 2017. The maximum supply is thus 210,700,000 ETC, roughly ten times that of [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC), while ETH has no cap.

ETC uses a PoW mining algorithm, which functions like [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) — miners are rewarded with new coins for validating the blockchain in competition with each other. The ETC block reward decreases with time, with the next drop due at block 15,000,000, roughly in April 2022 — from 3.2 ETC to 2.56 ETC per block.

## How Is Ethereum Classic (ETC) Secured?

Ethereum Classic uses the [Proof-of-Work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow) ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) consensus algorithm. By resolving computationally challenging riddles to create and validate blocks of transactions, Ethereum Classic miners protect the network.

In this process, the state of all the data on the blockchain is recorded. The network moves on to the next block as long as every miner or node agrees on the order in which the blocks are created. This process is referred to as consensus. 

As a minority chain, it has suffered regular attacks itself. These include several 51% attacks to gain control of mining hashrate and execute spurious transactions and double spend coins, the most recent of which occurred in August 2020.

Following a series of 51% attacks on the Ethereum Classic network in 2020, the underlying Ethash mining algorithm was changed. The event was called Thanos upgrade. 


## How is Ethereum Classic mined?

Miners use their hardware to solve complex mathematical equations and validate transactions on the Ethereum Classic network. The first miner to solve the equation and validate a new block receives a block reward in the form of ETC.

Miners use their hardware to solve complex mathematical equations and validate transactions on the Ethereum Classic network. The first miner to solve the equation and validate a new block receives a block reward in the form of ETC.

The network automatically adjusts the difficulty of mining Ethereum Classic every two weeks to maintain a stable block production rate. The difficulty is based on the total computational power of the network, and it becomes more challenging to mine ETC as more miners join the network.

## Where Can You Buy Ethereum Classic (ETC)?

ETC is a major market cap cryptocurrency and is freely tradable on a large number of major exchanges. 

Pairs are available against stablecoins, other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, while derivatives and institutional investment vehicles also exist.

Terra Classic,LUNC,terra-luna,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/4172.png,coin,"## What Is Terra Classic (LUNC)?

Terra is a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) protocol that uses fiat-pegged [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) to power price-stable global payments systems. According to its white paper, Terra combines the price stability and wide adoption of fiat currencies with the censorship-resistance of [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) and offers fast and affordable settlements.

Development on Terra began in January 2018, and its mainnet officially launched in April 2019. As of September 2021, it [offers](https://medium.com/terra-money/announcing-terrausd-ust-the-interchain-stablecoin-53eab0f8f0ac) stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar, South Korean won, Mongolian tugrik and the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights basket of currencies — and it intends to roll out additional options.

On May 28, 2022, the genesis block of the new chain was launched to conduct future transactions under the name [Terra (LUNA)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna-v2/), and the original Terra Chain was rebranded as Terra Classic. The original native token — LUNA has also been renamed as LUNA Classic (LUNC). Moreover, all network [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin) (UST, KRT, EUT) have been renamed to Terra Classic stablecoins (USTC, KRTC, EUTC). There will be no Terra stablecoins on the new chain.

There is a theory that the additional term “classic” is a reference to the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) / [Ethereum Classic](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-classic/) split in 2017. According to CEO, Do Kwon, the collapse of UST in the spring of 2022 is the equivalent moment of the Ethereum’s [DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) hack that took place in 2017.


## What Is Luna Classic (LUNC)?

Luna Classic (LUNC) is the first native token of Terra blockchain released in August 2018. $LUNC existed before the launch of the new chain — now branded Terra (LUNA) — and works with the original code of the Terra ecosystem.

The main function that the native token performed was to absorb the price deviation of the [algorithmic stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/algorithmic-stablecoin) — $UST. The price of the UST stablecoin was pegged to the US dollar by minting and burning UST tokens to balance the supply and demand of the coin. In May 2022, UST lost its peg and collapsed. The UST stablecoin algorithm created trillions of LUNA tokens, fell into a hyperinflationary spiral, and reduced the value of the original LUNA token by 99%.

What is the difference between Terra (LUNA) and Terra Classic (LUNC)?

Both versions of the token have the right to exist as a result of the implementation of a proposal called Terra Ecosystem Revival Plan 2. The essence of the plan is to split the current blockchain through [forking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fork-blockchain), which created a new chain in the ecosystem, preserving the previous version.

According to the recovery plan, the existing chain and token have been rebranded as Terra Classic. The new LUNA tokens were [airdropped](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/airdrop) to existing holders of LUNA and UST before the depeg and subsequent crash occurred.


### **Who Are the Founders of Terra Classic?**

Terra was founded in January 2018 by Daniel Shin and Do Kwon. The two [conceived](https://medium.com/kucoinexchange/kucoin-ama-series-terra-luna-full-transcript-a3019e664195) of the project as a way to drive the rapid adoption of blockchain technology and [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) through a focus on price stability and usability. Kwon took on the position of CEO of Terraform Labs, the company behind Terra.

Prior to developing Terra, Shin [co-founded](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201112/the-returnees.html) and headed Ticket Monster, otherwise known as TMON — a major South Korean e-commerce platform. He later [co-founded](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2020/03/133_162546.html) Fast Track Asia, a startup incubator working with entrepreneurs to build fully functional companies.

Kwon previously founded and served as CEO of Anyfi, a startup providing decentralized wireless mesh networking solutions. He has also worked as a software engineer for Microsoft and Apple.


#### **What Makes Terra Classic Unique?**

Terra seeks to set itself apart through its use of fiat-pegged stablecoins, stating that it combines the borderless benefits of cryptocurrencies with the day-to-day price stability of fiat currencies. It keeps its one-to-one peg through an algorithm that automatically adjusts stablecoin supply based on its demand. It does so by incentivizing LUNA holders to swap LUNA and stablecoins at profitable exchange rates, as needed, to either expand or contract the stablecoin supply to match demand.

Terra has established a number of partnerships with payments platforms, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. In July 2019, Terra [announced](https://medium.com/terra-money/terra-partners-with-mobile-payment-app-chai-29c593f0a364) a partnership with Chai, a South Korea-based mobile payments application, in which purchases made using the application on e-commerce platforms are processed via the Terra blockchain network. Each transaction is subject to (on average) a 2%–3% fee charged to the merchant.

In addition, Terra is supported by the Terra Alliance, a group of businesses and platforms advocating for the adoption of Terra. In February 2019, the company [announced](https://medium.com/terra-money/state-of-the-terra-alliance-d7f3ff8f6411) that e-commerce platforms from 10 different countries, representing a user base of 45 million and a gross merchandise value of $25 billion, were members of the alliance.


### **Terra Classic's Role for UST**

The LUNA token and [UST](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terrausd/) are mutually dependent, as the success of the [Terra ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-terra-a-guide-to-terra-s-ecosystem) is a function of the adoption of UST as a [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin). LUNA backs UST and is burned when demand for UST rises. Following upgrades like [Columbus-5](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/columbus-5-is-almost-here-what-does-that-mean-for-terra-and-its-users-flipside-crypto), the supply of LUNA could become highly deflationary in the long run.

On the flip side, the value of LUNA can also decrease if UST is perceived as unstable. UST briefly lost its peg following the Wormhole hack, leading to a temporary price crash for LUNA.

In May 2022, a series of liquidations and bank runs from investors pulling their funds out saw UST Classic depeg to as low as $0.044. LUNA Classic crashed over 99% from over $80. UST Classic never recovered its peg.

## How Many Terra Classic (LUNC) Coins Are There in Circulation?

As of August 2022, the total supply of Terra Classic (LUNC) is 6.9T, and there are 6.5T LUNC in circulation.


### **How Is the Terra Network Secured?**

The Terra blockchain is secured using a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm based on Tendermint, in which LUNA token holders [stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) their tokens as collateral to validate transactions, receiving rewards in proportion to the amount of LUNA staked. Tokenholders may also delegate others to validate transactions on their behalf, sharing in any revenue generated. Terra also [offers](https://docs.terra.money/validator/security.html) additional guidance to validator nodes on the best practices for helping to keep the network secure.

In May 2019, shortly after Terra's mainnet went live, blockchain verification and penetration testing firm CertiK [completed](https://medium.com/certik/certik-has-completed-a-security-audit-for-terra-project-e91fb81c371b) a security audit of the network. It examined its economic model to test against market manipulation, its architecture and its coding language. CertiK found that the ""modeling and mathematical reasoning"" of the Terra network were ""considered sound,"" although it would not comment on the blockchain's performance.

DFI.Money,YFII,yearn-finance-ii,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5957.png,token,"## What Is DFI.MONEY (YFII)?

DFI.MONEY, also known as YFII, is a fork of popular decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) aggregator platform yearn.finance ([YFI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/)).

Launched in July 2020, it aims to optimize returns for DeFi investors while adhering to changes proposed in an upgrade plan called YIP-8.

In addition to protocol changes, DFI.MONEY has also released new products, chief among which, the Vault, it describes as its “killer product.”

The native token of DFI.MONEY is YFII, a fixed-supply token which liquidity providers earn in accordance with their network interaction.


### Who Are the Founders of DFI.MONEY?

DFI.MONEY originated as a hard fork of yearn.finance, the aggregator for DeFi returns created by Andre Cronje. 

Cronje left the original incarnation of yearn.finance, iEarn, in early 2020, only to return to continue its development, whereupon its popularity grew considerably as DeFi became more mainstream.

In July 2020, mining and farming of yearn.finance’s YFI token ended, and a proposal to protect liquidity provision from whales earned 80% support among protocol participants. However, it was not adopted due to not meeting yearn.finance’s requisite 33% quorum requirement.

As a result, a group of users opted to hard fork the protocol to create DFI.MONEY, with its own token, YFII.

The hard fork implemented the proposal, known as YIP-8, which makes YFII rewards decrease each week, following a pattern popularized by [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC).


#### What Makes DFI.MONEY Unique?

DFI.MONEY essentially fulfils the same role in the DeFi marketplace as yearn.finance, subject to different protocol rules for its token and with some new features.

Its appeal is thus aimed at users of its predecessor who voted in favor of YIP-8, as well as newcomer DeFi investors who want to maximize returns by providing liquidity.

DFI.MONEY’s website states that its protocol is community-owned and does not offer commercial incentives such as developer rewards by default.

Users join one or both of two liquidity pools which feature [Curve](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/) (CRV) or [Balancer](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/balancer/) (BAL), earning YFII tokens as a reward for providing liquidity. 

DFI.MONEY also introduced a new feature, the Vault, which seeks to gain users the highest returns of any token automatically according to user-submitted strategies, without the users themselves manually setting up transactions.

#### How Many DFI.MONEY (YFII) Coins Are There in Circulation?

YFII is an ERC-20 standard token with a fixed supply of 40,000 YFII. According to the characteristics set out and accepted in YIP-8, no premine, presale or developer-allocated tokens were taken from the total supply.

DFI.MONEY states that the only way of earning YFII is by providing liquidity to the protocol. Tokens are distributed according to liquidity provision, with rewards decreasing weekly. Each of the two liquidity pools began with a supply of 20,000 YFII.

A schedule confirms that token distribution was completed 10 weeks after it began, at the end of September 2020.


### How Is the DFI.MONEY Network Secured?

DFI.MONEY states that YFII has a guaranteed fixed supply of 40,000 tokens which cannot be manipulated by developers.

This was made possible by sending keys allowing minting of new tokens to a so-called “blackhole” address, and access to them is permanently lost.

Developers published links to the transactions showing transfer of the keys to the blackhole.


### Where Can You Buy DFI.MONEY (YFII)?

YFII has become a popular trading token since its launch. As of October 2020, it is available on multiple major exchanges, with trading pairs featuring cryptocurrencies, [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) and other DeFi tokens.

[Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) and [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) are among the exchanges with the largest YFII volume.

Hedera,HBAR,hedera,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/4642.png,coin,"## What Is Hedera (HBAR)?

Hedera is the most used, sustainable, enterprise-grade public network for the decentralized economy that allows individuals and businesses to create powerful decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)).

It is designed to be a fairer, more efficient system that eliminates some of the limitations that older blockchain-based platforms face — such as slow performance and instability.

It was funded through an initial coin offering (ICO) in August 2018 and first launched open access to its mainnet just over a year later in September 2019. As part of the ICO, investors were able to purchase the platform’s native utility token (HBAR) at the lowest possible pricing. 

The HBAR token has a dual role within the Hedera public network. 

First and foremost, HBAR the fuel that powers Hedera services, such as [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), file storage and regular transactions. Second, it's used to help secure the network, since HBAR users can [stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) their tokens to assist with maintaining the integrity of the platform. 

Hedera (HBAR) is the native cryptocurrency of Hedera Hashgraph, a platform that is positioned as an alternative to traditional blockchain technology and aims to excel in speed, efficiency and security.

Older blockchains tend to use a consensus mechanism like proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) to validate transactions, while younger blockchains opted for proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)). The Hedera Hashgraph system has a structure that was created from scratch particularly for the project. Hedera is based on a PoS model that is believed to increase the efficiency of transaction verification in the network, provide a high level of security, and protect the network from hacker attacks. Its ecosystem has the underlying hashgraph consensus algorithm and the global enterprise governing body.

Hedera Hashgraph is a distributed ledger technology (DLT). According to the project website, Hedera differs from other blockchains because it uses a new consensus algorithm called hashgraph. It intends to process and execute transactions faster, eliminate delays, and smooth out the TPS (transactions per second) indicator. Hashgraph is claimed to be an upgrade in transaction speed, cost, and scalability.

Core network services by Hedera:

Consensus Service (HCS). With HCS, clients send messages to the network to negotiate consensus timestamping and order. In this case, the state is stored offline, and users can define privacy and access control.

Hedera Token Service (HTS). Thanks to HTS, token creation and management are available to customers. It supports built-in tokenization.

The goal of Hedera’s hashgraph is to increase the speed of transactions. Moreover, the network is also focused on high-volume operations: micropayments, data integrity and tokenization.

Like the EVM, the Hedera network maintains a virtual machine that writes smart contracts in the Solidity programming language. On top of that, Hedera offers a set of built-in [KYC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/kyc) and [AML](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/anti-money-laundering) checks.

From a technical point of view, Hedera is a form of distributed ledger technology. It is a hashgraph, or consensus algorithm, where users agree on the order in which transactions should be performed. However, Hedera is not exactly a blockchain. It has its own distinctiveness and works differently. With hashgraph, all transaction branches are merged, no block equivalent is thrown away, and each is used to reach consensus.

One of the most noticeable features of the network is the Gossip-about-Gossip protocol. According to Dr. Leemon Baird, Hedera's inventor, within the system nodes randomly transmit data about themselves to other nodes via hashgraph using the Gossip protocol. Soon, all nodes in a cluster become familiar with each other. Then a certain data structure is formed. It consists of a payload of transactions, a timestamp, a digital signature, and hashes to the previous structures. 

HBAR is Hedera's native token that powers applications on the Hedera network. HBAR is utilized to pay for network services, transaction fees, in-app payments and micropayments. Developers can pay network fees with HBAR tokens, namely: work with [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), file storage and currency exchange. HBAR is used to incentivize and pay network nodes.

Hedera Hashgraph has a decentralized governance system that is set apart. All critical decisions about pricing policy, software updates, and wealth management are made by the Governing Council.


### Who Are the Founders of Hedera Hashgraph?

Hedera Hashgraph has two founders: Dr. Leemon Baird and Mance Harmon.

Dr. Leemon Baird is credited as the investor of the hashgraph distributed consensus algorithm and currently works as Hedera's chief scientist. 

Prior to founding Hedera Hashgraph, Baird accumulated more than a decade of experience in various computer science and security roles and previously worked as a senior research scientist at the Academy Center by Cyberspace Research. He also holds the position of co-founder and CTO at Swirlds Inc., a platform for building DApps.

On the other hand, Mance Harmon is Hedera’s CEO and an experienced technology executive and seasoned entrepreneur. Harmon has around two decades of experience holding executive roles at prominent firms — many of which are in the IT security industry. Like Dr. Leemon Baird, Mance Harmon also holds a second position at Swirlds Inc., as its co-founder and CEO. 

In addition to the founders, the Hedera leadership team also comprises more than a dozen individuals, many of which have had distinguished careers.


#### What Makes Hedera Hashgraph Unique?

Unlike most other cryptocurrency platforms, Hedera Hashgraph isn’t built on top of a conventional [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain). Instead, it introduces a completely novel type of distributed ledger technology known as a Hashgraph. 

This technology allows it to improve upon many blockchain-based alternatives in several key areas, including speed, cost, and scalability. Hedera transactions have an average transaction fee of just $0.0001 USD and typically reach finality in under five seconds. Overall, Hedera Hashgraph claims it can handle more than 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) — compared to the around 5-20 for most popular proof-of-work (PoW)-based blockchains.

The platform offers several major network services. These include:



*   A token service that allows users to easily configure and mint both fungible and non-fungible tokens ([NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token)) on Hedera with just a few lines of code.
*   A [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) service that acts as a layer of trust for any application or network that needs a secure, verifiable log of events.
*   Smart contract tools that let developers build powerful and efficient decentralized applications.
*   Decentralized file storage services with features include proof-of-deletion, controlled mutability, and time-based file expiry.

#### How Many Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The Hedera Hashgraph token, HBAR, has a maximum total supply of 50 billion units. Out of this, almost seven billion were in circulation as of January 2021 — equivalent to around 14% of the total supply.

Hedera publishes regular reports detailing when the next wave of HBAR tokens will be unlocked. These reports can be viewed [here](https://help.hedera.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002789198-When-are-the-next-distributions-of-hbars-scheduled-). 

According to [Hedera's resources](https://help.hedera.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007177217-How-is-Hedera-management-compensated-#breadcrumb), the two project founders each have a coin grant of two billion HBARs, equivalent to 4% of the total supply each. These tokens are vested over a six-year period. 

Other senior executives at Hedera (that joined prior to 2018) have coin grants of between 250 million and 300 million coins. These tokens are vested over a period that ends in December 2021. 

According to Hedera's [Economics Whitepaper](https://hedera.com/blog/new-v3-of-the-hbar-economics-whitepaper) (published June 2020), around 17.03 billion HBAR is estimated to be in circulation by 2025 — equivalent to 34% of the total supply.


### How Is the Hedera Hashgraph Network Secured?

Hedera Hashgraph uses a novel consensus system known as Hashgraph consensus to keep its network secure. 

This uses a rotating governing council consisting of up to 39 highly diversified organizations that span across up to 11 different industries. These are involved with directing the Hedera codebase, voting on platform decisions and operating the initial nodes on the Hedera public network.

Hedera uses a novel form of [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoS) which allows HBAR users to stake their resources to help protect the network. Right now, all Hedera nodes are managed by either Hedera itself or the governing council members, but there are plans to switch to a permissionless system in the future.

 \
Overall, Hedera's security setup ensures it achieves ""asynchronous” [Byzantine fault tolerance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft) (ABFT) — meaning it can guarantee both the timing and order of a set of transactions, even if some data is delayed or lost.


### Where Can You Buy Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR)?

HBAR is a popular digital asset that is available to trade on several prominent exchange platforms, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), Bittrex and [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/). 

Some of the more popular HBAR trading pairs include HBAR/USDT, HBAR/BTC and HBAR/ETH, and there are also several fiat trading options for the cryptocurrency, including HBAR/USD, HBAR/KRW and HBAR/INR.

BNB,BNB,bnb,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1839.png,coin,"## What Is BNB?

Launched in July 2017, Binance is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange globally based on daily trading volume. Binance aims to bring cryptocurrency exchanges to the forefront of financial activity globally. The idea behind Binance’s name is to show this new paradigm in global finance — Binary Finance, or Binance.

Aside from being the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, Binance has launched a whole ecosystem of functionalities for its users. The Binance network includes the Binance Chain, [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain), Binance Academy, Trust Wallet and Research projects, which all employ the powers of [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) technology to bring new-age finance to the world. BNB is an integral part of the successful functioning of many of the Binance sub-projects.


### Who Are the Founders of BNB?

[Changpeng Zhao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cpzhao/) is the founder and CEO of Binance. In 2001, Zhao joined Bloomberg as head of tradebook futures development. He spent four years with the company and later joined Fusion Systems as a partner.

Since 2013, Changpeng Zhao has been actively involved with blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. He became head of development at Blockchain, and in 2015 he founded BijieTech. In 2017, Zhao officially launched Binance, and he has been the CEO of the company ever since.

[He Yi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yi-he-%E4%BD%95%E4%B8%80/) is a co-founder and chief marketing officer at Binance. She started her career as a TV anchor and presenter on China Travel TV in 2012. Later, in 2014, Yi co-founded OKCoin, which was the largest fiat-to-crypto exchange in China at the time. In 2017, she joined forces with Changpeng Zhao, and together they created the largest crypto exchange globally — Binance.


### What Makes BNB Unique?

Binance is a unique ecosystem of decentralized, blockchain-based networks. The company has grown to be the leading crypto exchange in a number of countries, and their side organizations are attracting significant interest as well.

One of the biggest competitive advantages Binance has is its drive for development. While the company started only as a crypto exchange back in 2017, today, Binance has spread its services among numerous different spheres. According to the company website, its mission is to become the infrastructure services provider for the entire blockchain ecosystem. 

Since launching the BNB, the exchange has also benefited from increased investor interest in the coin. BNB went through a significant price increase at the beginning of 2021, which has put it on the map of enterprise investors.

Measures like [BEP-95](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-binance-smart-chain-increased-bnb-s-value-the-bep-95-upgrade) have upgraded the already deflationary tokenomics to make BNB even more deflationary. Following the proposal, gas fees on Binance Smart Chain have become even lower, as the network burns a part of the fees to decentralize further. The proposal was modeled after Ethereum's famous [EIP-1559](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereums-london-hard-fork-goes-live).

This has helped Binance overcome several exploits of protocols on BSC, such as a [$200M exploit](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/pancake-bunny-price-crashes-after-defi-token-targeted-in-flash-loan-attack) of [Pancake Bunny](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakebunny/) and [several hacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/cream-finance-suffers-another-flash-loan-attack) of [Cream Finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cream-finance/). Despite these hacks, users return to Binance for its low fees and the abundance of [lucrative meme coins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/baby-doge-coin-up-143-as-other-memecoins-bleed) in its ecosystem.

### What Is BNB’s Auto Burn?

Within the crypto industry, a coin burn is a deflationary mechanism that is used to permanently remove coins from circulation. Most cryptocurrency projects, including Binance, periodically burn coins to sustain the value of their digital asset and create a deflationary effect.

In the case of Binance, the crypto exchange began the program in late 2017 and has so far burned over 38 million tokens via its quarterly burn to date. The crypto exchange has in mind to destroy up to 100 million BNB tokens through its quarterly burns, accounting for 50% of its circulating supply.

BNB utilizes two coin-burning mechanisms. The first mechanism consists of burning a portion of the tokens spent on transaction fees on the BNB Chain, and the second is its quarterly BNB burning events.

Previously, the quarterly burn event was based on revenue generated from the Binance centralized exchange. But under the new BNB Auto-Burn program, the number of tokens to be burned is calculated using a formula based on the total number of blocks produced on the Binance Smart Chain and BNB's average dollar-denominated price during the quarter.

As of July 2022, Binance had completed 20 BNB coin burn events. In total, 38,683,447.66 BNB tokens have been destroyed, reducing its initial 200M supply by 19.34%.

### How Many BNB Are There in Circulation?

There is an initial maximum supply of 200,000,000 BNB coins, of which 168,137,036 are currently in circulation as of September 2021.

Binance conducts quarterly burning of the BNB supply, with the goal of reducing the total supply by half — or 100,000,000 BNB. On July 18, 2021, it conducted its 16th quarterly burning, which was worth $390 million in BNB price at the time of burning. However, that was not the most expensive burn — on April 16, 2021, the exchange burned nearly $600 million worth, in BNB price at the time of burning.

According to the Binance [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.io/document/10/binance-whitepaper), exactly half of the maximum supply of BNB coins was allocated towards the initial coin offering (ICO) and public sale of the coin. The ICO was held in July 2017 shortly after the exchange launched, and saw Binance raise $15 million in funding, with BNB price at $0.10 during the ICO. Taking BNB price today, that represents an almost 4200X [return on investment](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/roi) (ROI). Another 40% of the total supply, or around 80,000,000 BNB coins, was distributed among the founding members and team. Finally, the remaining 10% of the maximum supply was split among angel investors.


### How Is the BNB Network Secured?

Initially, the BNB started as a traditional [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain. Later on, the company introduced its own blockchain, and the tokens started being issued from the Binance blockchain, secured by the Tendermint byzantine-fault-tolerant ([BFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft)) consensus mechanism.

While ERC-20 tokens rely on the proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus, which allows them to be extremely scalable, and allows for the creation of smart contracts. Unlike PoS, the Binance blockchain does not support smart contract functionalities. In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain is secured by the proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) consensus, which is far more limited and consumes large amounts of electrical and computing power.

EOS,EOS,eos,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1765.png,coin,"## What Is EOS?

The EOS Network is an open-source blockchain platform that prioritizes high performance, flexibility, security, and developer experience. As a third-generation blockchain platform powered by the EOS virtual machine, EOS has an extensible WebAssembly engine for deterministic execution of near fee-less transactions. 

EOS is the market's most scalable, divisible, and programmable digital currency. EOS is a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) network where stakeholders have the authority to select node operators. Due to the decentralized nature of the token distribution on EOS, power doesn't reside in the hands of block miners, but rather all parties involved in the EOS Network.

The EOS Network is attractive because of its technology and community. It allows developers to build projects that other blockchains cannot support. The network is straightforward and has multiple tools and educational resources to help users acclimate to the blockchain. 

## Who Are the Founders of EOS?

The EOSIO software, which the EOS Network was built upon, was developed by the company Block.one and architected by Daniel Larimer.

In June 2018, the EOS blockchain was launched by a decentralized group of block producers (BPs) who bootstrapped the network based on a token distribution snapshot from Block.one's ICO.

On August 25, 2021 consensus was reached by EOS block producers to fund the EOS Network Foundation (ENF), which was launched by Yves La Rose.

The EOS Network Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that coordinates financial and non-financial support to encourage the growth and development of the EOS Network. The ENF is the hub of the EOS Network, harnessing the power of decentralization as a force for positive global change to chart a coordinated future for EOS.

### What Makes EOS Unique?

The EOS Network is a 3rd generation Layer 1 blockchain that is low-latency and highly performant blockchain that liberates developers to align their build with what they imagine—bringing together programmable architectures, versatile blockchain infrastructures, and custom smart contracts. What makes EOS unique is its technological stack and resilient community.

The EOS Network has many communities with vibrant ideas and leadership. Token holders primarily work with developers and other ecosystem leaders to promote growth. The EOS community values transparency, openness, honesty, accountability, liberty, respect, and different core values of a blockchain. 
EOS is the first blockchain with a community-led foundation and user support. On EOS, token holders elected a foundation to spearhead network growth. During this same period, a group of community members started the EOS live support for users on the network. 

### How Many EOS Coins Are There in Circulation?

EOS Network has 995,528,087 EOS in circulation at the time of writing.

When the network launched, its software developer (Block.one) was allocated 100m EOS tokens locked in a 10 year vesting schedule. In December 2021, the EOS Network reached consensus to stop vesting those tokens when it essentially fired Block.one for failing to continue software development or support for the EOS ecosystem. The 68 million unvested tokens remain in the eosio.stake account and are locked out of circulation.

The Network continues operating using a 3% annualized inflation with 1% being directed to block producers and 2% funds the treasury for the EOS Network Foundation.


### How Is the EOS Network Secured?

EOS is built on delegated-proof-of-stake (DPOS), a form of proof-of-stake that gives token holders governance power relative to their stake in the system. The EOS token is a pro-rata claim on access to the EOS network’s resources, as well as a pro-rata claim on its governance rights. The EOS Network is a decentralized operating system governed by a DAO.

In DPOS, EOS token holders delegate their stake to elect representatives responsible for validating transactions. One of the advantages is that this helps eliminate consolidation, where smaller miners are pushed out by those with greater computing power and resources.

### Where Can You Buy EOS?

It is possible to [buy EOS](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-EOS) through Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bithumb, Upbit, and countless other exchanges. Given how widely used it is in the crypto industry, you’ll be hard pressed to find a trading platform that doesn’t support it.","{""website"":[""https://eosnetwork.com/""],""technical_doc"":[""https://eosnetwork.com/blog/category/eos-blue-papers/""],""explorer"":[""https://eosauthority.com"",""https://eosflare.io/"",""https://www.eosx.io/?partner=coinmarketcap"",""https://bscscan.com/token/0x56b6fb708fc5732dec1afc8d8556423a2edccbd6"",""https://www.oklink.com/cn/bsc/token/0x56b6fb708fc5732dec1afc8d8556423a2edccbd6""],""source_code"":[""https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap""],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/EosNetwork"",""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/eos"",""https://eosnetwork.com/blog/""],""chat"":[""https://t.me/EOSNetworkFoundation"",""https://discord.gg/eos-network""],""announcement"":[""https://t.me/ENFAnnouncements""],""reddit"":[""https://reddit.com/r/EOS""],""facebook"":[""https://www.facebook.com/groups/eosblockchain""],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/EosNFoundation""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1839.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x56b6fb708fc5732dec1afc8d8556423a2edccbd6"",""ContractPlatform"":""BNB Smart Chain (BEP20)"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://bscscan.com/token/0x56b6fb708fc5732dec1afc8d8556423a2edccbd6""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2502.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0xae3a94a6dc7fce46b40d63bbf355a3ab2aa2a588"",""ContractPlatform"":""HECO"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://http-mainnet.hecochain.com"","" https://http-mainnet-node.huobichain.com""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://hecoinfo.com/token/0xae3a94a6dc7fce46b40d63bbf355a3ab2aa2a588""}]","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9017.png"",""Name"":""Ledger"",""URL"":""https://www.ledger.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9020.png"",""Name"":""Trezor"",""URL"":""https://www.trezor.io/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9058.png"",""Name"":""Math Wallet"",""URL"":""http://www.mathwallet.org/cn/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9022.png"",""Name"":""Trust Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.trustwallet.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9025.png"",""Name"":""MetaMask"",""URL"":""https://metamask.io/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9016.png"",""Name"":""Coinbase"",""URL"":""https://wallet.coinbase.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9018.png"",""Name"":""Cobo"",""URL"":""https://cobo.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9049.png"",""Name"":""imToken"",""URL"":""https://token.im/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9062.png"",""Name"":""Scatter"",""URL"":""https://get-scatter.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9138.png"",""Name"":""Safepal"",""URL"":""https://www.safepal.io/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9152.png"",""Name"":""Binance Chain Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9188.png"",""Name"":""Atomic wallet"",""URL"":""https://atomicwallet.io/""}]",[]

Wrapped Bitcoin,WBTC,wrapped-bitcoin,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3717.png,token,"## What Is Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC]?

[Wrapped Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin) is a tokenized version of [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC) that runs on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (ETH) blockchain.

WBTC is compliant with [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) — the basic compatibility standard of the Ethereum blockchain — allowing it to be fully integrated into the latter’s ecosystem of decentralized exchanges, crypto lending services, prediction markets and other ERC-20-enabled decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) applications.

WBTC is also backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio via a network of automatically monitored merchants and custodians, ensuring that its price is pegged to Bitcoin at all times and allows users to transfer liquidity between the BTC and the ETH networks in a decentralized and autonomous manner.

Wrapped Bitcoin was first announced on October 26, 2018, and officially launched on January 31, 2019.

## How Are Wrapped Bitcoin Created?

The creation of Wrapped Bitcoin brings the world's leading cryptocurrency [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) into the world of Ethereum's [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) ecosystem. The WBTC token adheres to the [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token standard, with tokens created for those who want to convert BTC into WBTC.

All to-be-converted BTC is held by a custodian, who takes part in the actual minting and burning of Ethereum-based tokens. When WBTCs are burned, the user can reclaim their BTC balance from the custodian. During mining, users send BTC to the custodian for storage and receive an equivalent in WBTC tokens. BitGo is the biggest custodian for Wrapped Bitcoin, and they will mine a certain number of WBTC and send them to the merchant's Ethereum address.

The user who wants to swap between wBTC and BTC performs a trade — through a centralized exchange or atomic swap on a decentralized exchange — to move funds to the merchant. Once finalized, the user can use their BTC/wBTC as they see fit. If WBTC is converted to BTC, the associated Wrapped Bitcoin balance will be destroyed through a burn transaction.

The WBTC [DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) consists of governing members who decide on significant upgrades and changes to the protocol. Additionally, these members can serve as merchants or custodians managing BTC assets. 


## What Can You Do With WBTC?

As Wrapped Bitcoin tokens adhere to the ERC-20 token standard, one can use them across the broader Ethereum ecosystem. That includes trading them on decentralized exchanges  — like [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/), [1Inch](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/1inch/), [Sushiswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/) — and exploring decentralized finance opportunities through protocols and platforms supporting WBTC. 

DeFi opportunities for WBTC range from lending and borrowing to [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming), token swapping and [liquidity pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-pool). Various protocols and platforms support Wrapped Bitcoin, including [Aave](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/), [Balancer](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/balancer/), [Compound](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/), [MakerDAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maker/). Some of these providers may issue platform-native governance tokens as an extra incentive.

Using WBTC as colateral for a crypto-backed loan can be a significant option for businesses. Additionally WBTC holders can earn interest from supplying liquidity, although the APY will be relatively low.

Another option for WBTC is to engage in margin trading, where Wrapped Bitcoin is used to margin trade [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), stablecoins and other ERC-20 tokens. Users deploy WBTC to enhance fund security while trading. That process is fully non-custodial and powered by smart contract technology.

### Who Are the Founders of Wrapped Bitcoin?

The Wrapped Tokens project, of which WBTC is a part, wasn’t founded by individuals but is rather a joint project of three organizations: BitGo, Kyber Network and [Ren](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ren/).

BitGo, co-founded in 2013 by American computer scientist and entrepreneur Mike Belshe, is an institutional digital asset custody, trading and financial services firm. In addition to being one of the developers of WBTC, BitGo also serves as its original custodian — the entity that holds WBTC tokens and the keys needed to mint more of them.

Kyber Network is an on-blockchain liquidity protocol that enables the integration of different cryptocurrency tokens and DeFi applications. It was founded in 2017 by Loi Luu, Victor Tran and Yaron Velner and is based in Singapore. Along with Ren, Kyber Network has helped create WBTC and still serves as a merchant on its network — the institution that mints and burns WBTC tokens to maintain the 1:1 ratio of tokens to BTC reserves.

Similarly to Kyber, Ren is a company focused on cross-blockchain integration of cryptocurrency assets and DeFi applications via solutions such as RenBridge, RenVM and others. It was founded in 2017 by Taiyang Zhang and Loong Wang.


#### What Makes Wrapped Bitcoin Unique?

By virtue of being the oldest and largest cryptocurrency on the market, Bitcoin can boast a massive user base and a liquidity pool of several dozen billion dollars. However, its blockchain functionality is relatively basic by modern standards.

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum was built from the ground up to support more advanced use cases by utilizing the technology of smart contracts, giving rise to an entire industry dubbed “decentralized finance.” 

Ethereum and products derived from it offer their users such advanced financial instruments as lending and insurance, which do not rely on trusted intermediaries.

By “wrapping” BTC in the ERC-20 standard, WBTC enables full integration of a Bitcoin-like asset into this advanced environment of financial decentralized applications, bringing along the immense liquidity associated with the BTC market.

In addition, Wrapped Bitcoin makes the job significantly easier for exchanges, wallets and payment services that work with Ethereum: instead of having to run two separate nodes for ETH and BTC networks, they can support WBTC operations with just an Ethereum node.

Finally, Ethereum blockchain’s faster average blocktime — about 15 seconds vs 10 minutes respectively — increases the speed with which WBTC can be transacted, compared to actual bitcoins.

### Wrapped Bitcoin's Flow into Ethereum Network

Part of Bitcoin’s circulating supply has flowed into the Ethereum Network, corporate treasuries and exchange-traded investment products in the form of wrapped BTC (WBTC) in 2021. [According to Arcane Research](https://twitter.com/ArcaneResearch/status/1473998005477036040), while Bitcoin balance on crypto exchanges has fallen by roughly 1.2%, Bitcoin held in corporate treasuries, exchange-traded investment vehicles and on Ethereum has risen by 0.51%, 0.69% and 0.98% respectively. There is currently [$10.9B worth of WBTC](https://wbtc.network/dashboard/order-book) on the Ethereum network, as of February 2022. Besides Ethereum, WBTC is also available on the [Tron blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/), with a total value of $4.1M worth of Bitcoin.

CMC Alexandria has a basic into to Wrapped Bitcoin right [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin).


#### How Many Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC] Coins Are There in Circulation?

There is no predetermined schedule of WBTC issuance. Instead, WBTC is automatically minted or burned whenever users purchase or sell their tokens for Bitcoin via a system of merchants and custodians.

Because Wrapped Bitcoin is always backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio, the number of tokens in circulation is directly dependent on the amount of Bitcoin reserves in the WBTC network. As of October 2020, that number was just over 94,000 tokens, worth approximately $1 billion in total.


### How Is the Wrapped Bitcoin Network Secured?

WBTC tokens are secured by the parent blockchain they run on — Ethereum. In turn, ETH is protected by the Ethash [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) function, a representative of the Keccak family of hash functions.


### Where Can You Buy Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC]?

You can buy WBTC on several exchanges, both centralized and decentralized ones, which serve as merchants on the Wrapped Bitcoin network. Some of the major ones include:

Trust Wallet Token,TWT,trust-wallet-token,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5964.png,token,"To find out even more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Trust Wallet Token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-trust-wallet-token-twt-features-tokenomics-and-price-prediction).

## What Is Trust Wallet Token (TWT)?

Trust Wallet Token, or TWT, is a simple BEP-20 utility token that provides a range of benefits and incentives to Trust Wallet users. Trust Wallet itself is a mobile cryptocurrency wallet that supports dozens of popular native assets, in addition to popular tokens on the Ethereum, Binance and [TRON](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/) blockchains.

Holders of TWT tokens unlock a variety of benefits when using Trust Wallet, including discounts on in-app cryptocurrency purchases and on the use of decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) services. TWT holders can also participate in the governance of Trust Wallet and can vote on Trust Wallet update proposals, helping to shape the development of the app. 

Trust Wallet Token was initially launched as a BEP-2 asset on Binance Chain, but was relaunched as a BEP-20 token on Binance Smart Chain in October 2020.


## Who Are the Founders of Trust Wallet Token

Trust Wallet was founded by Viktor Radchenko in 2017. Based in Mountain View, California, Radchenko previously held development and engineering roles at several tech firms, and also co-founded Trucker Path in 2013 — the company behind one of the most popular apps for truckers and logistics firms. 

Radchenko turned his attention to the mobile cryptocurrency wallet industry when he found that “app stores did not have any open source wallets for [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and ERC20 tokens.”

The platform was acquired by [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) in July 2018 for an undisclosed sum, but Radchenko still works on the platform as part of the Binance team. The full [Trust Wallet team](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2218440709%22%5D&origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH) is not public, but it is known to comprise over 20 individuals — many of which have overlapping roles at Binance. 


## What Makes Trust Wallet Token Unique?

Trust Wallet Token is a utility token designed to provide additional value to users of the Trust Wallet mobile app — it doesn’t have any utility outside of the Trust Wallet ecosystem. 

Despite this, as a BEP-20 asset, Trust Wallet Tokens can be transferred to any wallet that supports Binance Smart Chain assets, where it may be exchanged against other assets or used as payment for services. Since it also confers voting rights and governance over the development of Trust Wallet and can be used for discounted DEX trades and in-app purchases, TWT has gone on to develop value of its own as a speculative instrument. 

TWT was also one of the first tokens to launch on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) — a high-performance [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) designed for smart contracts and decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)). As a result, TWT can be transferred with extremely low fees and near-instant transaction confirmation times.

## How Many Trust Wallet Token (TWT) Coins Are There in Circulation?

As part of the transition to Binance Smart Chain, 99% of the original TWT token supply was burned and the new maximum supply was set at 1 billion TWT — of this, just over a quarter is currently in circulation. 

The circulating supply of TWT will gradually grow as TWT tokens are earned by Trust Wallet users for completing various tasks, such as by participating in referral campaigns, taking quizzes and completing tasks within the app — like cryptocurrency [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) and trading.

As per the [official source](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/trust-wallet-token-twt-listed-on-binance-dex/62145), 40% of the TWT token supply will be targeted towards user acquisition, 15% will be distributed to the Trust Wallet community, 30% will be held in reserve and 15% is allocated to developers. As of October 2020, Trust Wallet has not yet published the full tokenomics or emission schedule for the Trust Wallet Token. 


## How Is the Trust Wallet Token Network Secured?

Based on Binance Smart Chain, the Trust Wallet Token is backed by a rigorously tested [proof-of-stake (POS)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) consensus mechanism. This is used to protect the network against a range of potential threats, including [51%](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack) and Sybil attacks. 

It’s also protected by a generous bug bounty program operated by Binance, which pays up to $10,000 in BNB to anybody that discovers a vulnerability on Binance Chain and its core smart contracts. 

Beyond this, as a BEP-20 asset, TWT is secured by the security of the wallet software used to manage it. For Trust Wallet, this includes a passcode security lock and a 12-word recovery phrase. 


## Where Can You Buy Trust Wallet Token (TWT)?

Trust Wallet Token is available to purchase and trade on a variety of platforms — including both centralized and decentralized exchanges. [MXC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mxc/) and [Binance DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance-dex/) are among the most liquid exchanges for TWT. The token is currently tradable against a range of other cryptocurrencies, including [Tether (USDT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB).

Bitcoin,BTC,bitcoin,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1.png,coin,"## What Is Bitcoin (BTC)?

[Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/an-intro-to-bitcoin) is a decentralized [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) originally described in a 2008 [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper) by a person, or group of people, using the alias [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto). It was launched soon after, in January 2009.

[Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-bitcoin) is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all [transactions](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-a-bitcoin-transaction-take) happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”

Some concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the [first-ever cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-beginner-s-guide-to-investing-in-cryptocurrencies) to come into actual use.


### Who Are the Founders of Bitcoin?

Bitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2021, the true identity of the person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown.

On October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer, online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be dubbed “[blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain).”

Just two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the [genesis block](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/genesis-block), thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price was $0 when first introduced, and most Bitcoins were obtained via mining, which only required moderately powerful devices (e.g. PCs) and mining software. The first known Bitcoin commercial transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. At Bitcoin price today in mid-September 2021, those pizzas would be worth an astonishing $478 million. This event is now known as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” In July 2010, Bitcoin first started trading, with the Bitcoin price ranging from $0.0008 to $0.08 at that time.

However, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Over the years a large number of people have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features.

Bitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others.


### What Makes Bitcoin Unique?

Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to appear on the market.

It has managed to create a global community and give birth to an entirely new industry of millions of enthusiasts who create, invest in, trade and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their everyday lives. The emergence of the first cryptocurrency has created a conceptual and technological basis that subsequently inspired the development of thousands of competing projects.

[The entire cryptocurrency market](https://coinmarketcap.com/) — now worth more than $2 trillion — is based on the idea realized by Bitcoin: money that can be sent and received by anyone, anywhere in the world without reliance on trusted intermediaries, such as banks and financial services companies.

Thanks to its pioneering nature, BTC remains at the top of this energetic market after over a decade of existence. Even after Bitcoin has lost its undisputed dominance, it remains the largest [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies), with a [market capitalization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/market-capitalization-market-cap-mcap) that surpassed the $1 trillion mark in 2021, after Bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $64,863.10 on April 14, 2021. This is owing in large part to growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, and the ubiquitousness of platforms that provide use-cases for BTC: [wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-a-bitcoin-wallet), exchanges, payment services, online games and more.

### How Much Bitcoin Is in Circulation?

Bitcoin’s [total supply](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics) is limited by its software and will never exceed 21,000,000 coins. New coins are created during the process known as [“mining”](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin): as transactions are relayed across the network, they get picked up by miners and packaged into blocks, which are in turn protected by complex cryptographic calculations.

As compensation for spending their computational resources, the miners receive rewards for every block that they successfully add to the blockchain. At the moment of Bitcoin’s launch, the reward was 50 bitcoins per block: this number gets [halved](https://coinmarketcap.com/halving/bitcoin/) with every 210,000 new blocks mined — which takes the network roughly four years. As of 2020, the block reward has been halved three times and comprises 6.25 bitcoins.

Bitcoin has not been premined, meaning that no coins have been mined and/or distributed between the founders before it became available to the public. However, during the first few years of BTC’s existence, the competition between miners was relatively low, allowing the earliest network participants to accumulate significant amounts of coins via regular mining: Satoshi Nakamoto alone is believed to own over a million Bitcoin.

[Mining Bitcoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mine-bitcoin) can be very profitable for miners, depending on the current hash rate and the price of Bitcoin. While the process of mining Bitcoins is complex, we discuss [how long it takes](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin) to mine one Bitcoin on CoinMarketCap [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/) — as we wrote above, mining Bitcoin is best understood as how long it takes to mine one block, as opposed to one Bitcoin. As of mid-September 2021, the Bitcoin mining reward is capped to 6.25 BTC after the [2020 halving](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-halvings-what-they-are-why-they-happen-and-why-you-should-care), which is roughly $299,200 in Bitcoin price today.


### How Is the Bitcoin Network Secured?

Bitcoin is secured with the [SHA-256 algorithm](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sha-256), which belongs to the SHA-2 family of hashing algorithms, which is also used by its fork Bitcoin Cash ([BCH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/)), as well as several other cryptocurrencies.

### Bitcoin Energy Consumption

Over the past few decades, consumers have become more curious about their energy consumption and personal effects on climate change. When news stories started swirling regarding the possible negative effects of Bitcoin’s energy consumption, many became concerned about Bitcoin and criticized this energy usage. A report found that each Bitcoin transaction takes 1,173 KW hours of electricity, which can “power the typical American home for six weeks.” Another report calculates that the energy required by Bitcoin annually is more than the annual hourly energy usage of Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million.  

The news has produced commentary from tech entrepreneurs to environmental activists to political leaders alike. In May 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk even stated that Tesla would no longer accept the cryptocurrency as payment, due to his concern regarding its environmental footprint. Though many of these individuals have condemned this issue and move on, some have prompted solutions: how do we make Bitcoin more energy efficient? Others have simply taken the defensive position, stating that the Bitcoin energy problem may be exaggerated. 

At present, miners are heavily reliant on renewable energy sources, with estimates suggesting that Bitcoin’s use of renewable energy may span anywhere from 40-75%. However, to this point, critics claim that increasing Bitcoin’s renewable energy usage will take away from solar sources powering other sectors and industries like hospitals, factories or homes. The Bitcoin mining community also attests that the expansion of mining can help lead to the construction of new solar and wind farms in the future. 

Furthermore, some who defend Bitcoin argue that the gold and banking sector — individually — consume twice the amount of energy as Bitcoin, making the criticism of Bitcoin’s energy consumption a nonstarter. Moreover, the energy consumption of Bitcoin can easily be tracked and traced, which the same cannot be said of the other two sectors. Those who defend Bitcoin also note that the complex validation process creates a more secure transaction system, which justifies the energy usage. 

Another point that Bitcoin proponents make is that the energy usage required by Bitcoin is all-inclusive such that it encompasess the process of creating, securing, using and transporting Bitcoin. Whereas with other financial sectors, this is not the case. For example, when calculating the carbon footprint of a payment processing system like Visa, they fail to calculate the energy required to print money or power ATMs, or smartphones, bank branches, security vehicles, among other components in the payment processing and banking supply chain. 

What exactly are governments and nonprofits doing to reduce Bitcoin energy consumption? Earlier this year in the U.S., a congressional hearing was held on the topic where politicians and tech figures discussed the future of crypto mining in the U.S, specifically highlighting their concerns regarding fossil fuel consumption. Leaders also discussed the current debate surrounding the coal-to-crypto trend, particularly regarding the number of coal plants in New York and Pennsylvania that are in the process of being repurposed into mining farms. 

Aside from congressional hearings, there are private sector crypto initiatives dedicated to solving environmental issues such as the Crypto Climate Accord and Bitcoin Mining Council. In fact, the Crypto Climate Accord proposes a plan to eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, And, due to the innovative potential of Bitcoin, it is reasonable to believe that such grand plans may be achieved. 


### What Is Bitcoin’s Role as a Store of Value?

Bitcoin is the first decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency. One of its most important functions is that it is used as a decentralized store of value. In other words, it provides for ownership rights as a physical asset or as a unit of account. However, the latter store-of-value function has been debated. Many crypto enthusiasts and economists believe that high-scale adoption of the top currency will lead us to a new modern financial world where transaction amounts will be denominated in smaller units.

The smallest units of Bitcoin, 0.00000001 BTC, are called [Satoshis](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/satoshi-sats) (or Sats in short), in a nod to the pseudonymous creator. At Bitcoin price now, 1 Satoshi is equivalent to roughly $0.00048.

The top crypto is considered a store of value, like gold, for many — rather than a currency. This idea of the first cryptocurrency as a store of value, instead of a payment method, means that many people buy the crypto and hold onto it long-term (or HODL) rather than spending it on items like you would typically spend a dollar — treating it as digital gold.


### Crypto Wallets

The most popular wallets for cryptocurrency include both hot and cold wallets. Cryptocurrency wallets vary from hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are able to be connected to the web, while cold wallets are used for keeping large amounts of coins outside of the internet.

Some of the top crypto cold wallets are Trezor, Ledger and CoolBitX. Some of the top crypto hot wallets include Exodus, Electrum and Mycelium.

Still not sure of which wallet to use? Check out CoinMarketCap Alexandria’s guide on the [top cold wallets of 2021](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/best-crypto-cold-wallets) and[ top hot wallets of 2021](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/10-best-crypto-hot-wallets-for-beginners).


## How Is Bitcoin’s Technology Upgraded?

A [hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hard-fork-blockchain) is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade. For example, if users A and B are disagreeing on whether an incoming transaction is valid, a hard fork could make the transaction valid to users A and B, but not to user C.

A hard fork is a protocol upgrade that is not backward compatible. This means every node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) needs to upgrade before the new blockchain with the hard fork activates and rejects any blocks or transactions from the old blockchain. The old blockchain will continue to exist and will continue to accept transactions, although it may be incompatible with other newer Bitcoin clients.

A [soft fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/soft-fork-blockchain) is a change to the Bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backward-compatible. This kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners upgrading to enforce the new rules.

Some examples of prominent cryptocurrencies that have undergone hard forks are the following: [Bitcoin’s hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-bitcoin-cash) that resulted in Bitcoin Cash, [Ethereum’s hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-vs-ethereum-classic) that resulted in Ethereum Classic.

Bitcoin Cash has been hard forked since its original forking, with the creation of Bitcoin SV. Read more about the difference between Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-vs-bitcoin-cash-vs-bitcoin-sv).

### What Is Taproot? 

Taproot is a [soft fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/soft-fork-blockchain) that bundles together BIP 340, 341 and 342 and aims to improve the scalability, efficiency, and privacy of the blockchain by introducing several new features. 

The two major changes are the introduction of the Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree (MAST) and Schnorr Signature. MAST introduces a condition allowing the sender and recipient of a transaction to sign off on its settlement together. Schnorr Signature allows users to aggregate several signatures into one for a single transaction. This results in [multi-signature](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/multisignature) transactions looking the same as regular transactions or more complex ones. By introducing this new address type, users can also save on transaction fees, as even complex transactions look like simple, single-signature ones. 

Although [HODL](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hodl)ers will probably not notice a big impact, Taproot could become a key milestone to equipping the network with [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) functionality. In particular, Schnorr Signatures would lay the foundation for more complex applications to be built on top of the existing blockchain, as users start switching to Taproot addresses primarily. If adopted by users, Taproot could, in the long run, result in the network developing its own [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) ecosystem that rivals those on alternative blockchains like [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). 

### What Is the Lightning Network?

The Lightning Network is an off-chain, layered payment protocol that operates bidirectional payment channels which allows instantaneous transfer with instant reconciliation. It enables private, high volume and trustless transactions between any two parties. The Lightning Network scales transaction capacity without incurring the costs associated with transactions and interventions on the underlying blockchain.

## Who Are the Largest Corporate Holders of Bitcoin?

A few years ago, the idea that a publicly traded company might hold Bitcoin on its balance sheets seemed highly laughable. The flagship cryptocurrency was considered to be too volatile to be adopted by any serious business. Many top investors, including Warren Buffett, labeled the asset a “bubble waiting to pop.”

This negative sentiment appears to have been broken, with a number of corporate behemoths buying up Bitcoin since 2020. In particular, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy set the pace after it bought $425 million worth of Bitcoin in August and September 2020. Since then, many others have followed suit, including EV manufacturer [Tesla](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/tesla-has-made-100m-on-bitcoin-already-but-elon-musk-is-being-criticized).

MicroStrategy has by far the largest Bitcoin portfolio held by any publicly-traded company. The business analytics platform has adopted Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset, aggressively buying the cryptocurrency through 2021 and 2022. As of August 30, 2022, the company had 129,699 Bitcoin in its reserve, equivalent to just over $2.5 billion.

Other top corporate holders include Marathon Digital Holdings, with 10,054 BTC, Coinbase (9,000), Square Inc. (8,027), and Hut 8 Mining Corp. (7,078).


## Is Bitcoin Political?

Bitcoin is becoming more political by the day, particularly after El Salvador began accepting the currency as [legal tender](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/el-salvador-plans-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender-why-thats-a-big-deal). The country's president, Nayib Bukele, announced and implemented the decision almost unilaterally, dismissing criticism from [his citizens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-atm-set-on-fire-as-el-salvador-marks-independence-day), the [Bank of England](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bank-of-england-criticizes-el-salvador-over-bitcoin), the [IMF](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/imf-warns-that-el-salvadors-plan-to-adopt-bitcoin-has-risks), [Vitalik Buterin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/reckless-buterin-attacks-el-salvador-s-president) and many others. Since the Bitcoin legal tender law was passed in September 2021, Bukele has also announced plans to build [Bitcoin City](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/el-salvador-to-build-world-s-first-bitcoin-city), a city fully based on mining Bitcoin with geothermal energy from volcanoes. 

Countries like [Mexico](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/mexico-has-no-plans-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender), [Russia](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/russia-says-it-wont-make-bitcoin-legal-tender-as-media-says-el-salvador-is-making-dangerous-gamble) and others have been rumored to be candidates also to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, but thus far, El Salvador stands alone. 

On the flip side, countries like China have moved to heavily [clamp down](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-price-falls-as-china-declares-all-crypto-transactions-are-illegal) on Bitcoin mining and trading activities. In May 2021, the Chinese government declared that all crypto-related transactions are illegal. This was followed by a heavy crackdown on Bitcoin mining operations, forcing many crypto-related businesses to flee to friendlier regions.

Surprisingly, the anti-crypto stance of the Chinese government has done little to stop the industry. According to data by the [University of Cambridge](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map), China is now the second-biggest contributor to Bitcoin's global hash rate, only behind the United States.

### How Much Is Bitcoin?

The current valuation of Bitcoin is constantly moving, all day every day. It is a truly global asset. From a start of under one cent per coin, BTC has risen in price by thousands of percent to the numbers you see above. The prices of all cryptocurrencies are quite volatile, meaning that anyone’s understanding of how much Bitcoin is will change by the minute. However, there are times when different countries and exchanges show different prices and understanding how much Bitcoin is will be a function of a person’s location.


### Where Can You Buy Bitcoin (BTC)?

Bitcoin is, in many regards, almost synonymous with cryptocurrency, which means that you can [buy Bitcoin](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Bitcoin) on virtually every crypto exchange — both for fiat money and other cryptocurrencies. Some of the main markets where BTC trading is available are:

Wrapped Dogecoin,WDOGE,wrapped-dogecoin,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/25284.png,token,"## What Is Wrapped Dogecoin [wDoge]?

Wrapped Dogecoin is a tokenized version of [Dogecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/) (Doge) that runs on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.

wDoge is compliant with ERC-20 — the basic compatibility standard of the Ethereum blockchain — allowing it to be fully integrated into the latter’s ecosystem of decentralized exchanges, crypto lending services, prediction markets, and other ERC-20-enabled decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

Its security model, inspired by [WBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), ensures a 1:1 conversion rate between wDoge and Dogecoin.

[BitGo](https://www.bitgo.com) serves as the custodian, while [The Dogecoin Foundation](https://foundation.dogecoin.com) is a member of the DAO.

Wrapped Dogecoin was officially launched on November 17, 2022.

## How Many wDoge Are There in Circulation?

There is no predetermined schedule of wDoge issuance. Instead, wDoge is minted or burned whenever users purchase or sell their tokens for Dogecoin via a system of merchants and custodians.

Because Wrapped Dogecoin is always backed by Dogecoin at a 1:1 ratio, the number of tokens in circulation is directly dependent on the amount of Dogecoin reserves in the wDoge network. The theoretical limit for the circulation supply is Dogecoins's circulating supply.

As of May 12th 2023, there are 998,409.952 wDoge in circulation.


## What Can You Do With wDoge?

wDoge gives Dogecoin holders access to Web3, DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts.

Some examples: 
- Use ERC-20 wallets.
- Use Ethereum DEXes like Uniswap.
- Buy [Own The Doge](https://pixels.ownthedoge.com) pixel NFTs .
- Use rich multisig wallets e.g. [Safe](https://safe.global).
- Create DAOs to fund Dogecoin initiatives.


## What Makes Wrapped Dogecoin Unique?

By virtue of being one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrencies on the market, Dogecoin can boast a massive user base and a liquidity pool of several billion dollars. However, its blockchain functionality is relatively basic by modern standards.

Unlike Dogecoin, Ethereum was built from the ground up to support more advanced use cases by utilizing the technology of smart contracts, giving rise to an entire industry dubbed “decentralized finance.”

Ethereum and products derived from it, offer their users advanced financial instruments such as lending and insurance, which do not rely on trusted intermediaries.

By “wrapping” Dogecoin in the ERC-20 standard, wDoge enables full integration of a Dogecoin-like asset into this advanced environment of financial decentralized applications, bringing along the immense liquidity associated with the Dogecoin market.

In addition, Wrapped Dogecoin makes the job significantly easier for exchanges, wallets, and payment services that work with Ethereum: instead of having to run two separate nodes for ETH and Dogecoin networks, they can support wDoge operations with just an Ethereum node.

## Who Are the Founders of Wrapped Dogecoin?

wDoge was cofounded by [BitGo](https://www.bitgo.com) and [BluePepper](https://bluepepper.io). The DAO members are BitGo, BluePepper, [The Dogecoin Foundation](https://foundation.dogecoin.com), and [MyDoge](https://www.mydoge.com).

BitGo, co-founded in 2013 by American computer scientist and entrepreneur Mike Belshe, is an institutional digital asset custody, trading, and financial services firm. In addition to being one of the developers of WBTC and wDoge, BitGo also serves as their original custodian — the entity that holds the Bitcoin and Dogecoin that back the wrapped assets.

BluePepper was co-founded in 2022 by part of the team that built the [dogethereum bridge](https://github.com/dogethereum/docs). Its focus is to create Dogecoin tools.


### Where Can You Buy Wrapped Dogecoin (wDoge)?

You can buy wDoge on [Bitmart](https://www.bitmart.com/trade/en-US?symbol=WDOGE_DOGE) and [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x09c2395f31257b922bfd9d3ca9ee6c5f308bee70)
You can request wDoge to be minted/burned through [BluePepper](https://bluepepper.io).


## How Is Wrapped Dogecoin Secured?

Decentraland,MANA,decentraland,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1966.png,token,"## What Is Decentraland (MANA)?

Decentraland (MANA) defines itself as a virtual reality platform powered by the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain that allows users to create, experience, and monetize content and applications. 

In this virtual world, users purchase plots of land that they can later navigate, build upon and monetize. 

Decentraland was launched following a $24 million initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) that was conducted in 2017. The virtual world launched its closed beta in 2019 and opened to the public in February 2020. Since then, users have created a wide range of experiences on their parcels of LAND, including interactive games, sprawling 3D scenes and a variety of other interactive experiences. 

Decentraland uses two tokens: MANA and LAND. MANA is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token that must be burned to acquire non-fungible ERC-721 LAND tokens. MANA tokens can also be used to pay for a range of avatars, wearables, names, and more on the Decentraland marketplace.

Decentraland (MANA) is a decentralized virtual world platform with software based on the Ethereum blockchain, where users create, test and monetize content. In short: users buy virtual plots of land as [NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) with MANA tokens on the Decentraland platform. Progress in the game depends only on players themselves, their efforts and their imagination.

The digital platform is completely owned by its users. Within the Decentraland metaverse, participants can explore the virtual world, purchase plots of land that can be monetized, create works of art, own non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and take part in a decentralized autonomous organization of the platform Decentraland [DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao). Due to the DAO, the community influences the development vector of the project. 

In addition, users have access to interactive applications, in-world payments and peer-to-peer communication. The 3D world resonates with many participants as Decentraland has many applications, both entertainment for gamers and business for investors.

Two types of tokens called MANA and LAND govern operations in Decentraland. They also allow users to interact with the platform.

MANA is the official currency of Decentraland. It’s an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) standard token that powers the Decentraland platform. With MANA, users can purchase plots of LAND, as well as pay for in-game items and services.

MANA gives its holders the right to vote in Decentraland DAO. MANA can be purchased on a cryptocurrency exchange or by selling collectibles on Decentraland Marketplace. The owner of tokens converts them to wrapped MANA, or wMANA, and then commits them to the DAO. One wMANA equals one vote. MANA can be exchanged for fiat currency and other digital assets.

As for LAND, it’s a non-fungible token (NFT) based on [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). It is used to track ownership of land parcels aka digital real estate. Like MANA, LAND is part of the protocol and confers voting rights, but LAND does not need to be fixed in the DAO. One LAND is equal to two thousand votes.

Players choose what to do with their land. Owners store tokens in crypto wallets and buy necessities with MANA tokens on the Decentraland Marketplace. Moreover, on the marketplace, participants can manage or exchange LAND tokens (priced in MANA). Holders use the marketplace to transact or transfer in-game items. All transactions are conducted, regulated and registered via the Ethereum blockchain.

Decentraland combines an online gaming space and blockchain technology. All control over the rules is given to the players, and token holders vote on in-game and organizational policies. The original goal was to form a decentralized virtual reality, but in practice, Decentraland has turned into a massive NFT market.

A special role in Decentraland is assigned to NFTs, such as collectibles, virtual equipment and real estate (LAND). However, for new players who want to join the universe and seize NFTs, the entry barrier will be high.

The Decentraland protocol is built on three levels using Ethereum smart contracts. On the consensus layer, the ownership of LAND is tracked and managed. The land content layer displays the content of the Decentraland virtual world. Finally, on the real-time layer, participants interact with each other.

The platform was co-founded by two blockchain experts, Ari Meilich and Esteban Ordano, in 2015. Officially it was launched a year later and became available only in February 2020, gradually turning from a 2D experiment into a full-fledged 3D world.

To sum up, Decentraland is a decentralized game and a 3D virtual reality platform where players own lands and create limitlessly. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) software is at the core, and governance is in the hands of the community. Through the native token MANA, players participate in any proposals for managing and improving the ecosystem, the auction system, and the in-game policy.


### Who Are the Founders of Decentraland?

Decentraland was co-founded by Ariel Meilich and Esteban Ordano — both of whom have stepped down from major positions at the project, but still work alongside Decentraland as advisors. 

Ariel Meilich previously held the role of project lead at Decentraland between 2017 and 2020, and is a serial entrepreneur that has founded several other startups, including an online translation agency and a CRM platform. He also worked as an analyst at Charles River Ventures, a prominent Silicon Valley venture fund. 

On the other hand, Esteban Ordano is Decentraland's former tech lead and has a long and varied history in the cryptocurrency space working as a software engineer at BitPay, Inc., an advisor to [Matic Network](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/matic-network/) and briefly operated his own smart contract development firm known as Smart Contract Solutions. 

Esteban is also credited with co-founding Zeppelin Solutions, an established blockchain technology infrastructure company. 

Although Ariel and Estaban are no longer leading the project, the development of Decentraland is still ongoing, with efforts being directed by the recently established Decentraland Foundation. 


#### What Makes Decentraland Unique?

Decentraland is built for content creators, businesses and individuals that are looking for a new artistic medium, business opportunity, or source of entertainment.

In total, the Decentraland gameworld — termed the “Metaverse” — is divided into 90,601 individual parcels of LAND, each of which is represented by an [ERC-721](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-721) non-fungible token. Each LAND is exactly 16m x 16m (256 square meters) and can be found at a particular coordinate in the Metaverse. 

Though LAND holders are free to develop their plot into whatever they choose, much of the Metaverse is broadly divided into several districts, each of which has a different size and theme. These districts were generated through individual crowdsales for MANA tokens, and parcels of LAND in these districts cannot be traded. 

As of January 2021, the cyberpunk-themed Aetheria is the largest district — comprising a total of 8,008 LAND. 

Decentraland is also one of the growing number of projects to use a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao)) structure for governance decisions. As a result, MANA token holders are in control of how the Decentraland world behaves, by proposing and voting on policy updates, the specifics of upcoming LAND auctions and the types of content that are allowed with the Metaverse.

Besides being a creative outlet, many Decentraland users currently monetize their LAND through leasing, advertising and paid experiences. Likewise, other users generate an income by creating and selling items on the Decentraland marketplace for MANA tokens.

#### How Many Decentraland (MANA) Coins Are There in Circulation?

As of January 2021, just north of 1.49 billion MANA tokens were in circulation. This is equivalent to around 68% of the current total supply of 2.19 billion MANA. 

The original total supply was set at 2.8 billion MANA, but has been reduced as more than 600 million MANA have been burned as a result of LAND auctions. 

There is also a range of further burn mechanisms in place to further reduce the circulating supply of MANA, including a 2.5% MANA burn on Decentraland marketplace transactions. 

MANA was originally designed to inflate at 8 percent in the first year, decreasing gradually over time to reduce the rate of inflation. But inflation is currently disabled. As per the [Decentraland glossary](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/glossary/), there are no plans to initiate this inflation ""until necessary"".

In total, 40% of the MANA supply was sold during the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). In addition, 20% was reserved to incentivize the community, 20% went to the development team and other early contributors, and the remaining 20% was held by Decentraland. Project lead tokens are no longer vested. 


### How Is the Decentraland Network Secured?

MANA is an ERC-20 token. This means it is based on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).

Ethereum is secured by a massive decentralized network of miners, which work together with thousands of nodes to ensure the Ethereum blockchain—and hence the MANA tokens—is protected against [attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack). 

As one of the most battle-tested [blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) in current usage, Ethereum is currently the most popular network for crypto tokens that don’t have their own native blockchain. 


### Where Can You Buy Decentraland (MANA)?

The MANA token currently benefits from excellent [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) and can be purchased, traded or sold on around 100 different exchange platforms. As of January 2021, [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) and [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/) are among the most liquid exchanges for MANA tokens.

### Challenges we are addressing

Today’s online sports industry trades on false promises of getting rich quick. Rage.Fan aims to address lack of transparency and ensures that participants get the maximum benefit.

**Opaque transactions processing and settlements**

Current platforms have absolutely zero visibility for fans in terms of points calculation, pool formulation, transactions or rewards distribution. The model is “house-driven” thus lacks transparency and visibility.

**Escalated cost models**

Fees charged by fantasy sport platforms are extremely high elevating the entry barriers for sports enthusiasts. Even worse, this eats into the rewards. Also, these platforms are charging fees without any transparency which reduces the trust that players put into the platform.

**Lack of fan influence**

Centralized fantasy sport platforms allow little or no voice to fans in the operations of the platform creating an imbalance in the power structure and allows the platform operators to have full control of the decision making.

Tether USDt,USDT,tether,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/825.png,token,"## What Is Tether (USDT)?

Launched in 2014, Tether is a blockchain-enabled platform designed to facilitate the use of fiat currencies in a digital manner. Tether works to disrupt the conventional financial system via a more modern approach to money. Tether has made headway by giving customers the ability to transact with traditional currencies across the blockchain, without the inherent volatility and complexity typically associated with a digital currency. As the first blockchain-enabled platform to facilitate the digital use of traditional currencies (a familiar, stable accounting unit), Tether has democratised cross-border transactions across the blockchain.

**What is the Tether USD₮ token?**

USD₮ is a digital dollar, powered by blockchain technology, a stablecoin that is pegged 1:1 to the USD.

USD₮ provides individuals and organizations with a robust and decentralized method of exchanging value while using a familiar accounting unit.

**How do Tether tokens work?**

Tether tokens exist as digital tokens built on several leading blockchains, including Algorand, Avalanche, Bitcoin Cash’s Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP), Ethereum, EOS, Liquid Network, Omni, Polygon, Tezos, Tron, Solana, Kava and Statemine. These transport protocols consist of open source software that interface with blockchains to allow for the issuance and redemption of Tether tokens. Every Tether token is 100% backed by Tether's reserves. As a fully transparent company, Tether publishes a record of the current reserve assets.

## Who Are The Founders Of Tether?

USDT — or as it was known at the time, Realcoin — was launched in 2014 by Brock Pierce, Reeve Collins and Craig Sellars.

Brock Pierce is a well-known entrepreneur who has co-founded a number of high-profile projects in the crypto and entertainment industries. In 2013, he co-founded a venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, which by 2017 had raised over $80 million in funding. In 2014, Pierce became the director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit established to help improve and promote Bitcoin. Pierce has also co-founded Block.one, the company behind EOS, one of the largest cryptocurrencies on the market.

Reeve Collins was the CEO of Tether for the first two years of its existence. Prior to that, he had co-founded several successful companies, such as the online ad network Traffic Marketplace,  entertainment studio RedLever and gambling website Pala Interactive. As of 2020, Collins is heading SmarMedia Technologies, a marketing and advertising tech company.

Other than working on Tether, Craig Sellars has been a member of the Omni Foundation for over six years. Its Omni Protocol allows users to create and trade smart-contract based properties and currencies on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Sellars has also worked in several other cryptocurrency companies and organizations, such as Bitfinex, Factom, Synereo and the MaidSafe Foundation.


### What Makes Tether Unique?

USDT’s unique feature is the fact that its value is guaranteed by Tether to remain pegged to the U.S. dollar. According to Tether, whenever it issues new USDT tokens, it allocates the same amount of USD to its reserves, thus ensuring that USDT is fully backed by cash and cash equivalents.

The famously high volatility of the crypto markets means that cryptocurrencies can rise or fall by 10-20% within a single day, making them unreliable as a store of value. USDT, on the other hand, is protected from these fluctuations.

This property makes USDT a safe haven for crypto investors: during periods of high volatility, they can park their portfolios in Tether without having to completely cash out into USD. In addition, USDT provides a simple way to transact a U.S. dollar equivalent between regions, countries and even continents via blockchain — without having to rely on a slow and expensive intermediary, like a bank or a financial services provider.

However, over the years, there have been a number of controversies regarding the validity of Tether’s claims about their USD reserves, at times disrupting USDT’s price, which went down as low as $0.88 at one point in its history. Many have raised concerns about the fact that Tether’s reserves have never been fully audited by an independent third party.

## Tether Enters the Latin American Market

In May 2022, Tether announced the launch of MXNT, a new stablecoin backed by the Mexican peso. The move marked its expansion into the Latin American market following earlier debuts of its USDT, EURT and CNHT stablecoins, pegged to the U.S. dollar, euro and Chinese yuan, respectively.

Upon launch, MXNT will be available on three major blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon and Tron.

According to the firm’s CTO, Paolo Ardoino, the decision to expand into Latin America was fueled by an increase in cryptocurrency usage in the region. Notably, a report from cryptocurrency payments company Triple A revealed that 40% of Mexican companies were interested in adopting cryptocurrencies in one form or the other, with 71% within the segment specifically focused on cryptocurrency usage.

Tether named Mexico a “prime location” for the next Latin American crypto hub. The plan is to onboard as many new users within the Latin American market, and use the launch of MXNT as a testing ground for future fiat-pegged currencies in the region.


### Is Tether Entering the Social Media Market?

In July 2022, Tether, alongside peer-to-peer data network Hypercore and its sister company Bitfinex, collaborated on a social media app called Keet.

The fully encrypted video chat application is currently a desktop-only app for now, but there are plans to extend the product to mobile devices soon.

Keet app is the first app to be deployed on Holepunch, a platform that allows developers to build Web3 apps. And although Keet is still a closed-source project, the companies plan to make it open-source by the end of the year.

Commenting on why Tether was launching a chat app, Ardoino, who doubles as the chief strategy officer at Holepunch, simply said “freedom of speech.”

### How Many Tether (USDT) Coins Are There In Circulation?

There is no hard-coded limit on the [total supply](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics) of USDT — given the fact that it belongs to a private company, theoretically, its issuance is limited only by Tether’s own policies. However, because Tether claims that every single USDT is supposed to be backed by one U.S. dollar, the amount of tokens is limited by the company’s actual cash reserves.

Moreover, Tether does not disclose its issuance schedules ahead of time. Instead, they provide daily transparency reports, listing the total amount of their asset reserves and liabilities, the latter corresponding to the amount of USDT in circulation.

As of September 2020, there are over 14.4 billion USDT tokens in circulation, which are backed by $14.6 billion in assets, according to Tether.


### How Is the Tether Network Secured?

USDT does not have its own blockchain — instead, it operates as a second-layer token on top of other cryptocurrencies’ blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, Bitcoin Cash and OMG, and is secured by their respective hashing algorithms.


### Where Can You Buy Tether (USDT)?

It is possible to [buy Tether](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-TetherUS) / USDT on a large number of cryptocurrency exchanges. In fact, USDT’s average daily trading volume is often on par or even exceeds that of Bitcoin. It is especially prominent on those exchanges where fiat-to-crypto trading pairs are unavailable, as it provides a viable alternative to USD. Here are some of the most popular exchanges that support Tether trading:

Esco Coin,ESCO,esco-coin,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/25308.png,token,"The ESCO project, encapsulated by the token $ESCO, is a playful yet purposeful entry in the expansive world of cryptocurrencies. $ESCO was conceived as more than just another meme coin; it aspires to bring a light-hearted and engaging experience to the crypto world while simultaneously offering potential value to its holders. The creators of $ESCO believe that cryptocurrency should be accessible and enjoyable for everyone, and have therefore crafted a coin that users can hold, trade, and even share with friends as a fun means of participating in the crypto community. The coin’s name and brand are inspired by a well-known meme, and while it pays homage to this shared digital culture, it has no direct affiliation with any individuals or entities associated with the meme.

To acquire $ESCO, one would need to create a digital wallet, such as MetaMask, load it with Ethereum (ETH), and then connect the wallet to Uniswap. On Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, users can swap their ETH for $ESCO. This process is straightforward and allows anyone with access to ETH to join the $ESCO community. As part of the project's commitment to accessibility, the process of switching ETH to $ESCO is smooth and intuitive, making it easy even for those who are relatively new to the crypto space.

The $ESCO project has a total supply of 330 trillion coins, with 93% of these allocated to a liquidity pool. The remaining 7% of coins will be used for the listing of the coin on centralized exchanges and for future development, which will be managed through a multi-signature wallet. Unlike many other tokens, $ESCO does not impose any taxes or fees on transactions, living up to its name as a fun and accessible coin. The project’s roadmap outlines its intended growth and development trajectory but also leaves room for unexpected and exciting developments along the way. The $ESCO project thus presents a dynamic, accessible, and entertaining entry into the world of cryptocurrency.","{""website"":[""https://escocoin.com/""],""technical_doc"":[],""explorer"":[""https://etherscan.io/token/0x7163436b8efffb469f6bb81cc908b1661d4795e6""],""source_code"":[],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/esco-coin""],""chat"":[""https://t.me/escocoinofficial""],""announcement"":[],""reddit"":[],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/escocoin""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1027.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x7163436b8efffb469f6bb81cc908b1661d4795e6"",""ContractPlatform"":""Ethereum"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://etherscan.io/token/0x7163436b8efffb469f6bb81cc908b1661d4795e6""}]",[],[]
Tether Gold,XAUt,tether-gold,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5176.png,token,"**What is Tether Gold (XAU₮)?**

Tether Gold (XAU₮) is a stablecoin that provides ownership on a 1:1 basis of one fine troy ounce of gold on a physical bar of gold that meets the Good Delivery standard of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). This technology allows access to a stablecoin that provides ownership of physical gold while avoiding the drawbacks associated with physical gold, such as high storage cost and limited accessibility.
Note: XAU₮ tokens can be fractionated up to six decimal places (i.e. in increments as small as 0.000001 troy fine ounce).

**What Makes Tether Gold Unique?**

* Easy to Transport
Transporting physical gold is challenging, however, transporting your XAUt tokens is as easy as taking your other crypto-assets with you, whenever you need to.

* Easy Divisibility
It’s difficult to split up your physical gold bars. However XAUt tokens are divisible into increments as small as 0.000001 fine troy ounce of gold.

* 24/7 Trading with Ease
Trading physical gold limits you to your location and trading hours. XAUt tokens however, can be traded 24/7, 365 days a year from anywhere in the world on exchanges that list XAUt Tokens.

* Easily Redeemable
Should you ever want to redeem your XAUt tokens for physical gold, you can. We deliver physical gold bars to any address in Switzerland.

* Easy Storage
Storing your physical gold can be expensive and can expose you to geopolitical risks. Storing your XAUt tokens is as easy as storing your other crypto-assets.

* Easy Verifiable
All physical gold that backs XAUt tokens can be tracked on [our website](https://tether.to/en/transparency/#xaut). At any point in time, you can verify your gold allocation in our vaults.

MAGIC,MAGIC,magic-token,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/14783.png,token,"## What Is Magic (MAGIC)?

MAGIC is the utility token that connects gaming communities in the Treasure Metaverse: a decentralized [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) ecosystem which sits on [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-arbitrum), one of [Ethereum’s](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) [Layer 2](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) scaling solutions.

MAGIC is a cross-game currency that connects games, players, metaverses, and communities, all within [Web 3.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/web-3-0). The token was launched in September 2021 so its community could buy and sell in-game NFTs on Treasure. It also acts as a reserve currency for Treasure’s metaverse. 

Players can earn MAGIC tokens by gaming, mining, and participating in [Bridgeworld](https://trove.treasure.lol/games/bridgeworld), Treasure’s flagship game. Treasure now hosts twelve other games on its platform, some of which allow you to use and generate MAGIC tokens like in Bridgeworld. These include [Beacon](https://trove.treasure.lol/games/the-beacon), a free-to-play fantasy action rogue-lite RPG; and [Realm](https://trove.treasure.lol/games/realm), a world-building and exploration game. 


## Who Are the Founders of Magic?

Treasure, the platform served by MAGIC, was established by three co-founders: John Patten (Strategy), Gaarp (Growth), and Karel Vuong (Operations). Not much is known about the team’s experience prior to launching Treasure. 

Treasure and $MAGIC are operated by a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) (DAO), which consists of 36 community contributors. The DAO’s team members include experienced developers, product managers, economists, creative marketers, artists, and many enthusiastic gamers.

## What Makes Magic (MAGIC) Unique?

MAGIC is the official currency of the Treasure ecosystem. It acts as a cross-metaverse currency that links together separate gaming communities. It was designed to become increasingly scarce over time as more players join the ecosystem. 

You can earn and use MAGIC tokens in Bridgeworld, Treasure’s flagship game, and in Treasure’s twelve other games. You can also stake MAGIC tokens in the Atlas Mine in order to help govern the Treasure platform. 

Treasure is a community-driven gaming project: small gaming communities are at the center of its ecosystem. Each smaller gaming community is “connected through lore, guilds, resources, and MAGIC.” These separate communities can trade NFTs and collaborate using MAGIC tokens. More established communities can, for instance, use MAGIC to help develop new or emerging projects.

Treasure integrates DeFi, NFTs and gaming into its ecosystem as three separate elements: there’s MAGIC, the cross-game digital currency; Treasures, which are in-game NFT items; and Legions, the platform’s in-game NFT characters. MAGIC tokens let you transform Treasure NFTs into productive assets, and Legions help you earn Treasure NFTS and mine MAGIC tokens.

MAGIC is therefore secured by Ethereum’s [Layer-1](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) (PoS) [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism).

Despite the critical role of educators in shaping the future generation, they are often undervalued and underpaid. Additionally, parents frequently lack control over their children's educational content.

At its core, the Open Campus Protocol is a community-driven initiative that harnesses the power of blockchain technology to create a fairer education system. By decentralizing the creation and distribution of educational content, the Open Campus Protocol empowers students to access more diverse educational content while providing educators with new opportunities to earn revenue and gain recognition for their contributions. The ultimate goal of the Open Campus Protocol is to revolutionize the US$5 trillion Education industry by returning control to educators and learners.

Optimism,OP,optimism-ethereum,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/11840.png,token,"## What Is Optimism (OP)?

[Optimism (OP)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/optimism-ethereum/) is a [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) blockchain on top of [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). Optimism benefits from the security of the Ethereum mainnet and helps scale the Ethereum ecosystem by using [optimistic rollups](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/optimistic-rollup). That means transactions are trustlessly recorded on Optimism but ultimately secured on Ethereum.

Optimism is one of the biggest scaling solutions for Ethereum with over $500 million in [TVL](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl). It is home to 97 protocols, the biggest being [Synthetix (SNX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/synthetix-network-token/), a derivatives exchange, [Uniswap (UNI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/), a [DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex), and [Velodrome (VELO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/velodrome-finance/), an [AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm). Users can begin their journey on Optimism by adding the chain on their [Metamask](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/metamask) and [bridging](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bridges) tokens like [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) to the L2. On May 31, 2022, Optimism conducted a highly anticipated [airdrop](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/airdrop) of its OP token. 


## Who Are the Founders of Optimism?

Optimism is led by the Optimism Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to growing the Optimism ecosystem. Similar to Ethereum, Optimism aims to become a fully decentralized public good that is not profit-oriented. Optimism is completely funded by donations and grants, and pledges to produce infrastructure that promotes the growth and sustainability of public goods.


## What Makes Optimism Unique?

Optimism is designed around four core tenets:



* Simplicity
* Pragmatism
* Sustainability
* Optimism

Optimism aims for the minimum number of moving parts while building a layer-two solution for Ethereum. In practice, this means using proven Ethereum code and infrastructure when possible. Optimism thus aims to keep its code as simple as possible and work directly with existing codebases.

The ecosystem further emphasizes pragmatism and is driven by the real-world needs and constraints of its own team and the users engaging with the ecosystem. Hence, Optimism aims to build iteratively and implement features like EVM equivalence gradually.

Optimism's design process is built around the idea of long-term sustainability and not taking shortcuts to scalability. That is why it uses optimistic rollups and takes advantage of the consensus mechanism of Ethereum to scale the network. Blocks are constructed and executed on the L2 (Optimism), while user transactions are batched up and submitted to the L1 (Ethereum). The L2 has no [mempool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary), and transactions are immediately accepted or rejected. This guarantees a smooth user experience while ensuring security through the Ethereum consensus mechanism. 

Transactions are submitted to Ethereum without direct proof of validity and can be challenged for a certain period of time (currently seven days). After that, a transaction is considered final. That is why withdrawals from Optimism to Ethereum take seven days to complete.

## How Many Optimism (OP) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Optimism aims to create an ecosystem, where value is generated for its three constituencies:



* Token holders receive value through the productive re-deployment of sequencer revenue.
* Contributors and builders receive value from retroactive public goods funding. 
* Users and community members receive value from ongoing airdrops and project incentives.

In short, demand for OP block space generates revenue, which is distributed to public goods, which drives more demand for blockspace. That is why Optimism's token allocation looks as follows:



* Ecosystem fund (25%): split between the governance fund (5.4%), the partner fund (5.4%), the seed fund (5.4%), and unallocated (8.8%).
* Retroactive Public Goods Funding (20%)
* User airdrops (19%): split into a first airdrop of 5% and subsequent airdrops yet to be announced.
* Core contributors (19%): people who help bring the Optimism Collective from concept to reality
* Investors (17%)

The initial token supply is 4,294,967,296 OP tokens, at an inflation rate of 2% a year. In Year 1, 30% of the initial token supply will be made available to the Foundation for distribution. After the first year, token holders will vote to determine the Foundation's annual OP distribution budget. The Foundation expects to seek the following annual allocations:



* Year 2: 15% of the initial token supply
* Year 3: 10% of the initial token supply
* Year 4: 4% of the initial token supply


## How Is the Optimism Network Secured?

Optimism utilizes [optimistic rollups](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/optimistic-rollups-for-the-rest-of-us). Optimistic Rollups (ORs) can trustlessly record transactions on the second-layer blockchain and broadcast periodic merkle roots of the transactions to the first-layer blockchain. External validators verify these merkle roots, which delays withdrawing funds from layer-twos running on optimistic rollups (usually by one week). 


## Where Can You Buy Optimism (OP)?

OP is available on [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/), [Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/), [Bybit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bybit/) and [Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/).

Toncoin,TON,toncoin,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/11419.png,coin,"## What Is Toncoin (TON)?

Toncoin (TON) is a decentralized [layer-1 blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary) developed in 2018 by the encrypted messaging platform Telegram. The project was then abandoned, taken over by the TON Foundation, and renamed from ""Telegram Open Network"" to ""The Open Network"".

Since 2020, the technology has been developing thanks to a non-commercial group of supporters and an independent community of enthusiasts who called themselves the TON Foundation. Toncoin, formerly known as Gram, is the native cryptocurrency of the TON network.

The original idea was to integrate TON into an easy-to-use application that allows users to buy/send/store funds. Clients pay transaction fees and use TON to settle payments or validate transactions. Toncoin utilizes the [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) (PoS) consensus model for network scalability and reliability. According to the project website, the platform provides its customers with fast, transparent and secure payment services, facilitating transactions with minimal fees and third-party applications. 

The developers’ mission is to build a full-fledged ecosystem with decentralized storage, decentralized services, a domain name system (DNS equivalent), an anonymous network, an instant payment platform, and affordable/fast transaction processing.

The Open Network is a community-driven blockchain with a flexible architecture and focus on serving a typical consumer. TON stands out due to the fast processing/validation of [transactions per second](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/transactions-per-second) (TPS). In September 2021, the network processed a then-world record of 55,000 TPS during a contest, although the current TPS could be in the hundreds of thousands or even millions. This feature allows the project to grow rapidly while avoiding performance losses. At the same time, the project does not harm the environment.


## Who Founded Toncoin?

Originally, the blockchain platform was created by brothers Nikolai and Pavel Durov, and developed by the Telegram team. Telegram planned to launch an on-chain token called Gram and establish a platform for [decentralized applications](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) (dApps).

Gram was getting a lot of attention, which started to cause trouble. Its development was prohibited by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gram was considered securities, and the SEC banned the release of Gram tokens.

The Telegram team brought TON to the state of an almost full-fledged product. However, in 2020, Telegram CEO, Pavel Durov, left the project, and the development was handed over to independent crypto enthusiasts.

From the very beginning, the project was created as an open-source code so anyone could continue the development. The current network was launched and developed by Anatoliy Makosov and Kirill Emelianenko, members of the community called NewTON (later the TON Foundation).


## What Makes Toncoin Unique?

TON has a multi-level structure built on the principle of sharding or segmentation (""blockchain within a blockchain""). A [sharding](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sharding) feature involves the use of multiple subnets ([shards](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/shard)) on the same blockchain, where each shard has a specific purpose. It allows the net to avoid the accumulation of unverified blocks and speeds up tasks. The TON network consists of the master, work and shard chains.

The developers focus on scalability, efficiency and mass adoption. Due to the well-established interaction between segments, the network provides ultra-fast transactions, verifying and processing a massive amount of TPS.

The TON network offers the following services: TON Wallets, a built-in wallet function designed to transfer funds and interact with platform services and offers two categories of wallets: [custodial](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/custodial) and [non-custodial](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-custodial); TON Services allows developers to create various [dApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) while users can access third-party apps through a user-friendly interface; TON Storage offers the benefits of private encryption using the private key of the owner's wallet; TON Proxy uses all platform components and allows clients to access the TON blockchain via decentralized VPNs; TON DNS (decentralized name system) makes it possible for traditional websites to work in the TON network, allowing users to set short, readable names.

## How Many Toncoin (TON) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The TON network has its native token, Toncoin, with a circulating supply of 1.22B TON and a maximum supply of 5B TON.

Toncoin was designed to fuel the ecosystem. It can be used to build decentralized applications (dApps), act as a transaction processing fee, as a cross-chain transaction fee, and as a staking payment to secure the blockchain and services. The list of use cases also includes payment for decentralized data storage, TON DNS/TON Proxy, and other fees within decentralized services. Validator fees are also paid in TON. In addition, people can vote with TON for changes and development within TON's governance program.


## How Is the Toncoin (TON) Network Secured?

The network utilizes the proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus mechanism to validate transactions. Moreover, Toncoin is used to reward validators. Nominators can also provide tokens to validators and receive rewards. Validators and nominators are managed with smart contracts, providing the network with extra protection. [Smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) are executed using TON Virtual Machine (TVM).

Arbitrum,ARB,arbitrum,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/11841.png,token,"## What Is Arbitrum (ARB)?

Arbitrum is an [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) (L2) scaling solution. It uses [optimistic rollups](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/optimistic-rollup) to achieve its goal of improving speed, scalability and cost-efficiency on Ethereum. Arbitrum benefits from the security and compatibility of Ethereum. Another benefit is the higher [throughput](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/throughput) and lower fees compared to Ethereum. That is made possible thanks to moving most of the computation and storage load off-chain.

Arbitrum’s native token is called ARB and is used for [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance). Offchain Labs, the developers behind Arbitrum, announced the shift to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure — the Arbitrum DAO. ARB holders can vote on proposals that affect the features, protocol upgrades, funds allocation and election of a Security Council.

Arbitrum has an ambitious roadmap for 2023, which includes: Launching its own layer-three solution called Orbit; Enabling developers to deploy programs written in popular programming languages like Rust, C++, and more using Stylus; Expanding its validator set to include more independent institutional validators; Moving its protocol to layer two with Arbitrum One.

On March 16, 2023,  Arbitrum announced their highly anticipated airdrop of ARB. The token will be airdropped to early users and DAOs building on Arbitrum, with 12.75% of the total supply to be distributed. Recipients were rewarded on a point-based system depending on their interaction with the Arbitrum network until a cutoff date of March 1, 2023. The token generation event is on March 23, 2023.


## Who Are the Founders of Arbitrum?

Arbitrum is developed by Offchain Labs, a New York-based development company. Its founders are Ed Felten, Steven Goldfeder and Harry Kalodner, former Princeton University researchers with years of experience in computer science, cryptography and blockchain.

Ed Felten is a computer science professor at Princeton and served as President Obama’s Deputy CTO. He is the co-founder and Chief Scientist of Offchain Labs.

Steven Goldfeder is a computer scientist and entrepreneur who received his Ph.D. from Princeton. He is also the co-founder and CEO of Offchain Labs.

Harry Kalodner is a computer scientist and Ph.D. candidate at Princeton. He is also the co-founder and CTO of Offchain Labs.

In 2021, Offchain Labs announced that it raised $120 million in its latest Series B funding led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, valuing it at $1.2 billion. Other prominent investors include Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, Mark Cuban and more

## What Makes Arbitrum Unique?

Arbitrum uses optimistic rollups to stand out from other scaling solutions for Ethereum. It claims to offer several advantages over other optimistic rollup solutions, such as:

Compatibility: Arbitrum supports unmodified EVM contracts and transactions, meaning that any existing Ethereum [DApp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) can run on Arbitrum without any code changes.

Scalability: Arbitrum can handle thousands of transactions per second with low fees and fast finality, while maintaining the security guarantees of Ethereum.

Flexibility: Arbitrum allows developers to deploy programs written in popular programming languages like Rust, C++, and more using Stylus, its upcoming EVM+ equivalence feature.

Decentralization: Arbitrum does not rely on any centralized operator or sequencer to order transactions. Instead, it uses a decentralized network of validators who stake ARB tokens and earn fees for securing the network.

Arbitrum also has a vibrant ecosystem of DApps, wallets, tools and partners that make it one of the leading scaling solutions for Ethereum. 

Some of the protocols that are available on the network include: [GMX (GMX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gmx/), [Treasure (MAGIC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/magic-token/), [Camelot (GRAIL)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/camelot-token/), [Radiant Capital (RDNT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/radiant-capital/), [Vela Exchange (VELA)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/vela-token/), [ZyberSwap (ZYB)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zyberswap/), [Dopex (DPX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dopex/), [PlutusDAO (PLS)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/plutusdao/), [TridentDAO (PSI)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tridentdao/), [Jones DAO (JONES)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/jones-dao/) and more.

The growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem can be seen from its [total value locked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl) (TVL) metric. According to DeFiLlama, Arbitrum's TVL reached a peak of $3.2 billion in November 2021 and currently stands at around $1.85 billion as of this writing. This makes it the highest TVL among all other Layer 2 ecosystems.

## How Many Arbitrum (ARB) Coins Are There in Circulation?

ARB is the native governance token of Arbitrum. It will launch on March 23rd 2023, distributing 12.75% of the total supply of ARB tokens to eligible recipients and DAOs.

The utility of the ARB token is to enable decentralized governance of the Arbitrum ecosystem. ARB holders govern the Arbitrum network by voting on governance proposals for the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains. They can also influence how funds of the DAO treasury will be used. Governance proposals can include upgrades to the chain, changes to network parameters, allocation of grants and bounties, integration of new features and more.

ARB does not work as a gas fee token like ETH does on the Ethereum network. Instead, the fees on Arbitrum are paid in ETH or any other [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token supported by DApps. This means that ARB holders do not need to spend their tokens to use Arbitrum services, but rather can stake them and earn fees for securing the network.

The total supply of ARB tokens is fixed at 10 billion. The token allocation is as follows: Arbitrum DAO treasury: 42.78% (4.278 billion), Offchain Labs teams and advisors: 26.94% (2.694 billion), Investors: 17.53% (1.753 billion), airdrop to users: 11.62% (1.162 billion), airdrop to DAOs: 1.13% (113 million).


## How Is Arbitrum Secured?

Arbitrum derives its security from the Ethereum network, which provides consensus and finality for Arbitrum transactions. In other words, Ethereum guarantees the validity of the rollup’s off-chain computation and data availability behind the computation.

The use of optimistic rollups means Arbitrum executes transactions on the rollup outside of Ethereum, and bundle multiple transactions in a batch before submitting it to mainnet. As the term “optimistic” suggests, the off-chain transactions are assumed to be valid and no proof-of-validity is submitted. In case of a dispute, there is a time period after the rollup is submitted where anyone can challenge the transaction by submitting a fraud proof.

## Where Can You Buy Arbitrum (ARB)?

ARB can be purchased on numerous centralized exchanges, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/), [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/), [Bybit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bybit/), [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/), [Bitfinex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitfinex/) and more. It is also available for trading on decentralized exchanges like [Uniswap V3 (Ethereum)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v3/), [Uniswap V3 (Arbitrum)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v3-arbitrum/) and [SushiSwap (Arbitrum)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/sushiswap-arbitrum/).

## What Is Immutable (IMX)?

[Immutable](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/immutable-x/ico/) positions itself as the first [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) scaling solution for [NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). According to Immutable, its blockchain does away with Ethereum’s limitations like low scalability, a poor user experience, illiquidity, and a slow developer experience. Instead, users benefit from instant trading and massive scalability while enjoying zero gas fees for minting and trading NFTs without compromising user or asset security. To achieve that, Immutable is built with STARK [zk-rollups](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zero-knowledge-rollups), a technology that Vitalik Buterin considers Ethereum to be “all-in on.”

Thanks to this technology, users will be able to create and distribute assets like [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) and [ERC-721](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-721) tokens on a massive scale. Chris Clay, the game Director of Gods Unchained, a project already building on Immutable, stated that Immutable allows Gods Unchained to implement a new meta-system that was previously impossible. In this fashion, Immutable aims to create a world-class experience for users and developers alike. 


## Who Are the Founders of Immutable?

Immutable was founded by James Ferguson, a Forbes 30 Under 30 entrepreneur that previously led a software development team at a billion-dollar eCommerce company, and his brother Robbie Ferguson, a Thiel fellow and Forbes 30 Under 30 entrepreneur as well. 

The team consists of more than 100 members from different backgrounds like blockchain, FAANG, finance, fintech, and management consulting. It raised a seed round in 2018 and a $15 million Series A in September 2019. Investors included some of the “who is who” in blockchain investing, such as Coinbase, Naspers, Nirvana Capital, Apex Capital Partners, Continue Capital and Galaxy Digital. 


## What Makes Immutable X Unique?

Immutable X benefits from being one of the first layer-two solutions that utilize zk-rollups and focus exclusively on NFTs. With zk-rollups growing in importance as a scaling solution, the project finds itself at the cutting edge of development in the Ethereum ecosystem. Immutable X has a good chance of becoming the default “NFT blockchain” in the future, provided its promised transaction speed of more than 9,000 tps can be achieved. 

A crucial component to fulfilling this promise is the API abstraction layer. Thanks to REST APIs, every NFT-related interaction like minting, trading, and transferring is a simple API call on Immutable X. The company anticipates this to be a key component to attracting new entrants like established gaming and content companies in the space.

Moreover, users will not have to switch networks when connecting their wallets. The protocol also provides an intermediate layer called the “Link,” which enables an NFT-specific wallet experience and allows Immutable X to support a third-party marketplace ecosystem without security risks. 

With its shared global order book facilitating protocol liquidity, NFT marketplaces can be built on Immutable X without a backend. In consequence, third-party marketplace solutions can co-exist with the protocol’s native marketplace. The protocol also expects to lower the barriers of entry for content creators and smaller developers with this solution.

## How Many Immutable (IMX) Coins Are There in Circulation?

IMX is the protocol’s native ERC-20 utility token. The token’s three core use cases are fees, staking and governance. 20% of the protocol’s fees must be paid in IMX, and users can stake IMX to receive a proportional share of the network’s fees. Token holders can also vote on governance proposals by holding IMX. The total supply of IMX is two billion, according to the following token distribution:



* Ecosystem development - 51.74%: user rewards, developer grants, liquidity provision, marketing purposes.
* Project development - 25%
* Private sale - 14.26%: one year cliff, monthly unlock over two years.
* Public sale - 5%: six-months unlock.
* Foundation - 4%: ecosystem development-related initiatives like liquidity provision, one-year cliff, monthly unlock over four years.


## How Is the Immutable Network Secured?

Immutable is a [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) blockchain with zero [gas](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas) fees, where operators can set their own trading fees. In contrast to other scaling solutions to Ethereum, a 51% attack on Immutable is unfeasible, as it is not a centralized side chain but benefits from inheriting the native security of the Ethereum blockchain. Immutable uses zk-rollups, meaning assets are traded on the second-layer blockchain, but the validity proof of a transaction is stored on the layer-one blockchain, in this case Ethereum. Immutable uses STARK proofs because, unlike SNARKs, they are post-quantum-secure and provide greater user security despite the greater cost.

Immutable chose to stay on Ethereum as a first-layer solution because the team considers Ethereum best to represent the philosophy of trustless, decentralized asset ownership. In the team’s words, Ethereum has always prioritized centralization over short-term scalability upgrades, even though it has suffered from problematic gas fee spikes and network congestion, thus still remaining the main blockchain for NFT projects to build on.

USDD,USDD,usdd,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/19891.png,token,"## What Is USDD?

USDD is a [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/algorithmic-stablecoin) issued by the TRON DAO Reserve. It’s pegged to the value of the US dollar and aims to provide a reliable, decentralized cryptocurrency for [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) transactions. USDD can be used for payments, trading, [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) and as a value store.

USDD is backed by a number of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and [TRON](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tron). To ensure stability and security, the reserve is over-collateralized, meaning that it holds more assets than the amount of USDD currently in circulation.


## Who Are the Founders of USDD?

Justin Sun is the founder of the TRON, which is behind the USDD stablecoin. Launched on May 5, 2022, USDD is on the TRON blockchain and is also available on Ethereum and BNB Chain.


## What Makes USDD Unique?

USDD is issued and redeemed via smart contracts on TRON. This allows for fast and secure transactions, as well as transparent and verifiable records of USDD issuance and redemption. It also lets users join [staking pools](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking-pool). 

A decentralized community of stakeholders oversees the management and development of USDD, and makes decisions on behalf of the wider community via the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR). The TDR is the principal custodian of USDD and is responsible for preserving the value of the currency and maintaining a stable exchange rate. 

It was established as a separate financial organization to protect the Tron ecosystem against the effects of extended economic downturns, financial panic, and unstable exchange prices for both centralized and decentralized Tron stable currency. 

Its primary roles are as a lender of last resort, a regulator of risk-free interest rates, a manager of liquidity through the release and restriction of funds, and an implementer of monetary and exchange rate policies.

## How Many USDD Coins Are There in Circulation?

USDD stablecoin is intended to maintain a fixed exchange rate of 1:1 with the US dollar. This implies that for every USDD coin in circulation, a corresponding amount of US dollars is set aside in reserve. 

$2 billion worth of USDD has been authorized, while $1.25 billion worth of coins remain authorized but not yet issued. 

As of June 2023, the total supply of USDD is around $741K, and the total collateral is around $1.2 billion. These are mainly held in TRX, BTC and TUSD.


## How Is the USDD Network Secured?

Any stablecoin’s security relies heavily on the stability of the assets that underpin it. As such, the USDD protocol over-collateralizes the protocol with highly liquid assets, including BTC, TUSD and TRX. 

In order to keep the currency stable when its reserve assets’ values change as a result of adverse market conditions, the protocol’s monetary policy allows it to adjust the reserve asset ratios dynamically.

OKB,OKB,okb,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3897.png,token,"##What Is OKB (OKB)?

OKB is a cryptocurrency released by the OK Blockchain Foundation and Maltese crypto exchange, OKEx. The exchange is one of the largest in the world and[ currently ranks](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/) third in liquidity, fourth in trading volume, and provides a wide selection of trading pairs. OKEx is similar in many aspects to the cryptocurrency exchange giant[ Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/), but there are a few key differences. The OKEx platform has its own[ cloud mining service](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cloud-mining), and the company has a more focused reach in providing options trading for users. Meanwhile, Binance strives to offer a broad range of crypto services globally.

[OKB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/okb/) is the OKEx utility token that enables users to access the crypto exchange's special features. The coin is used to calculate and pay trading fees, grant users access to voting and governance on the platform, and reward users for holding OKB. 

OKEx has become a world-leading trading floor since its launch in 2017. The platform launched in the spring of 2017 and emerged as an offshoot from the original OKCoin platform (operating since 2013 in China). OKCoin now focuses on exchanging fiat for crypto, while OKEx focuses on crypto trading with a built-in[ API](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/api) for algorithmic trading. The exchange also gives users access to a multi-currency wallet and functions for[ margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading). 

###Who Are the Founders of OKB?

Jay Hao joined OKEx as CEO from the beginning, and he still holds the position. Hao has dedicated his career to technology and engineering. He has followed the blockchain industry for quite some time, with a focus on blockchain-based apps for video streaming and mobile gaming. Prior to joining OKEx, Hao had twenty years of experience in the semiconductor industry. He has developed a broad range of codecs: UVLED, ASIC, FPGA, and multimedia codecs and SOCs for multimedia processors. During this time, Hao accumulated impressive experience in product development and management.

Another key management team member is Mingxing “Star” Xu. He founded OKCoin in China in 2013 and has earned himself a big reputation in the industry. In 2017, Xu co-founded the separate OKEx exchange in Malta, which operates under a separate legal entity. Today Xu is the CEO of the OK Group.

##What Makes OKB (OKB) Unique?

The OKB token plays an important role in the OKEx ecosystem. It allows users to receive up to a 40% discount on transactions (depending on the number of tokens a user has). The exchange divides users into two status groups: regular and VIP. Regular users are assigned a level according to their OKB stock, and VIP users get a level according to their trading volume. The commissions are updated daily, and users get a discount depending on their respective level.

Platform members can receive passive income if they have OKB tokens, and the token is involved in OKEx Earn (this project helps users earn on their assets). Another purpose of the OKB token is to allocate funds on the OKEx Jumpstart platform. Participation on Jumpstart is available only after registration on the site — then sales are made through MixTrust.

OKB is the native asset of the OKExChain (the OKEx blockchain). The OKB token is used on the chain to facilitate spot trading, derivatives trading, and the simultaneous development of several scalable applications. Additionally, a layered architecture reduces[ consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) times, improves scalability, and boosts security.

To add value to OKB and make the digital coin more attractive to holders, OKEx regularly burns tokens every three months and records the coin burn on the official[ website](https://www.okex.com/support/hc/en-us/articles/360062074332-OKB-Buy-Back-and-Burn-report-2021-3-01-2021-05-31-). For this procedure, OKEX uses 30% of the income from commissions fees. On top of that, welcome bonuses are provided to new users.

Hot wallets vs. cold wallets: what’s the difference? We analyzed this topic in an article on[ CMC Alexandria.](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/hot-wallets-vs-cold-wallets-whats-the-difference)

##How Many OKB Coins Are There in Circulation?

The global utility token is similar to[ Binance Coin (BNB)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/). 50% of service fee incomes are distributed among token holders in proportion to their OKB balance. The privileges of OKB include: the right to vote on the platform, the ability to invest, and the ability to trade on OKEx.

There are 1 billion OKB on the market with the following allocations: 

* 40% - Founders & Project; 
* 10% - Investors; 
* 50% - AirDrops & Rewards; 
* 700 million OKB are locked until 2022. This means that the total supply in 2021 is 300 million tokens. 

The 700 million additional OKB that will be released in 2022 will be distributed as follows: 

* 100 million awarded to early investors; 
* 200 million stays with the founding team; 
* 100 million allocated to the OK Blockchain Foundation; 
* 300 million left for public awards.

##How Is the OKB Network Secured?

The coin is an[ ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20)<span style=""text-decoration:underline;""> token</span> that relies on a proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) consensus. OKB operated on the Ethereum blockchain, but later the company moved to its own blockchain — the[ OKExChain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/okexchain/).

OKEx is a very transparent platform. Developers assure that security is their top priority as OKEx maintains a reliable and stable trading environment. They use load balancing on servers, distributed clusters, and other technologies for protection.

Furthermore, OKEx has developed[ hot and cold wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/hot-wallets-vs-cold-wallets-whats-the-difference) — cold wallets being one of the safest methods for storing cryptocurrencies. Hot wallets, however, require maximum attention to security and capabilities. Therefore, OKEx added a semi-autonomous multi-signature feature that enables fast, convenient, and secure transactions.

##Where Can You Buy OKB (OKB)?

The easiest way to obtain OKB coins is to buy them via OKEx. However, there are also many alternative cryptocurrency exchanges where you can purchase or trade the token. These include[ OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/),[ Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/),[ Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/),[ HitBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hitbtc/),[ BiONE](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bione/),[ LBank](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/lbank/),[ Hotcoin Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotcoin-global/),[ Coin Ex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinex/),[ ProBit Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/probit-exchange/),[ Hotbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotbit/).

Loom Network,LOOM,loom-network,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2588.png,token,"## What Is Loom Network (LOOM)?

Loom Network is a platform as a service that is built on top of [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and allows developers to run large-scale decentralized applications. This platform was released on October 1st, 2017. 

The goal of this is to allow application developers to have [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) that can access much more computing power when it is required, or maintain the same power at lower costs for tasks such as trials for onboarding new users or applications that simply do not need the full security of blockchain to begin with. 

In this system you have the ability to interact with APIs developed by third parties which are not on chain. Loom attempts to be the ultimate platform that allows smart contract developers to create applications without the need to switch to another programming language. 

As such, they can easily integrate their applications with the outside world.

The Loom Network runs on Plasma, which is a scaling solution that allows for faster transactions throughout the network.


## Who Are the Founders of Loom Network?

The Loom Network was founded by Matthew Campbell, James Martin Duffy and Luke Zhang in 2017. 

Matthew Campbell is one of the co-founders and principal of the Loom Network.

## What Makes Loom Network Unique?

Loom Network is a platform as a service that allows Ethereum Solidity applications to be run through side chains. 

This means that the applications can have consensus mechanisms specific for their needs and potential threat model. Loom makes scaling decentralized applications faster and easier on the Ethereum network and uses the DPoS sidechains for scalability with [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) through the security of Ethereum mainnet.

The LOOM token acts as a membership token that each member receives in order to get access to all of the apps that run on the Loom Network itself. This token functions on all of the DAppChains that run on the Loom Network and lets you transfer digital assets and data between Ethereum and Loom DAppChains.

Genopets is the world’s first Free-to-Play, Move-to-Earn NFT mobile game that makes it fun and rewarding to live an active lifestyle. By integrating your daily activity with a Web3 GameFi economy, Genopets turns your real-life movement into fuel in a role playing game that lets you earn crypto while you play.

Genopets is the gamification of an active lifestyle. A Genopet is your digital companion whose evolution and growth is inextricably linked to your own. Walking around the mall? Jogging at the gym? Running between meetings in your office? No matter how you stay active, your Genopet is always by your side, counting the steps you’ll later use to explore the Genoverse.

Genopets is a move-to-earn game that does more than count your steps and reward you for how much you walk. The game is predicated on you building a bond with your digital pet and taking care of it every day by taking care of yourself. 

Paying homage to the nostalgia of taking care of our Tamagotchi, evolving and battling our Pokémon, or even raising our first real-world pet, the emotional connection between one's self  and their pet is a powerful force. That emotional force is the premise of Genopets and ultimately what will help motivate you to live a more active lifestyle.

USDC,USDC,usd-coin,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3408.png,token,"## What Is USDC (USDC)?

USDC is a [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) that is pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis. Every unit of this cryptocurrency in circulation is backed up by $1 that is held in reserve, in a mix of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. The Centre consortium, which is behind this asset, says USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions.

The stablecoin originally launched on a limited basis in September 2018. Put simply, USDC’s mantra is “digital money for the digital age” — and the stablecoin is designed for a world where cashless transactions are becoming more common.


Several use cases have been unveiled for the USDC. As well as providing a safe haven for crypto traders in times of volatility, those behind the stablecoin say it can also allow businesses to accept payments in digital assets, and shake up an array of sectors including decentralized finance and gaming.

 

Overall, the goal is to create an ecosystem where USDC is accepted by as many wallets, exchanges, service providers and dApps as possible.


## Who Are the Founders of USDC?

The Centre Consortium has two founding members. One of them is the peer-to-peer payment services company Circle, while the other is the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange. Other crypto ventures are open to join this consortium.

 

Explaining the rationale behind USDC, Circle co-founders Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville wrote: “We believe that an open internet of value exchange can transform and integrate the world more deeply, eventually eliminating artificial economic borders and enabling a more efficient and inclusive global marketplace that connects every person on the planet.”

 

In 2020, Circle and Coinbase collectively announced a major upgrade to USDC’s protocol and smart contract. The goal of these enhancements is to make it easier for USDC to be used for everyday payments, commerce and peer-to-peer transactions.


## What Makes USDC (USDC) Unique?

The stablecoin market has become exceedingly crowded over recent years — but USDC has aimed to stand head and shoulders over competitors in several ways.

 

One of them concerns transparency — and giving users the assurance that they will be able to withdraw 1 USDC and receive $1 in return without any issues. To this end, it says a major accounting firm is tasked with verifying the levels of cash that are held in reserve, and ensuring this matches up with the [number of tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics) in circulation.

 

Unlike some crypto ventures, Circle and Coinbase have also achieved regulatory compliance — and this has helped pave the way for international expansion. Both projects are also well-funded, giving the stablecoin certainty.

 [Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/) briefly contemplated [diversifying the funds backing USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/facing-criticism-coinbase-promises-usdc-stablecoin-will-be-100-dollar-backed-again), but retracted that proposal after heavy community backlash. The transparency over the provenance of its funds has been a big reason for USDC's success. Unlike its rival [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), which has found itself embroiled in repeated [investigations](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/is-tether-untouchable-the-latest-twist-in-a-long-running-drama), USDC has never been accused of any wrongdoing. That has led to USDC gobbling up much of USDT's dominance in the [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin) market: although USDT commanded a 74%:16% lead in market share in February 2021, this has shrunk to a 45%:30% lead in February 2022.

## How Much Is Held in USDC Asset Reserves?

Following the [collapse](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ust-plummets-to-0-38-and-luna-falls-82-in-24-hours-as-do-kwon-fails-to-deliver-recovery-plan) of TerraUSD, stablecoin issuers have been under intense scrutiny over the quality of the reserves backing their tokens. In a transparency move, Circle Internet Financial LLC (Circle), the issuer of the USDC stablecoin released its reserves report as of July 31, 2022.

According to the report, the total USDC reserves held by the company consist of $42.3 billion worth of US Treasury Securities and total cash deposits of $12.2 billion. The monthly reserve report was issued by leading global accounting firm Grant Thornton.

The accounting firm later released an independent attestation dated August 24, 2022. It reads:

“_In our opinion, the Reserve Information in the accompanying USDC Reserve Report as of July 31, 2022 is fairly stated, based on the criteria set forth in the USDC Reserve Report, in all material respects._”


### World’s Largest Asset Manager Shows Interest in USDC

In a seemingly loosely regulated space, USDC has continued to distinguish itself from other stablecoin projects by forging ties with traditional financial institutions. 

Following a $400 million funding round, which saw participation from BlackRock, Fidelity, Fin Capital, and Marshall Wace LLP, BlackRock revealed that it had “entered into a broader strategic partnership with Circle, which includes exploring capital market applications for USDC.”

In addition to partnering with the world’s largest asset manager, the stablecoin provider has inked other deals with big names from the world of traditional finance. In March, news broke that America’s oldest bank BNY Mellon would serve as the primary custodian of the assets backing USDC stablecoins. Meanwhile, a [press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/circle-announces-400m-funding-round-301523647.html) revealed that BlackRock will serve as a primary asset manager of USDC cash reserves.

## How Many USDC (USDC) Are There in Circulation?

It’s a bit difficult to give an exact number here — as in theory, the number of USDC that can exist is limitless. New coins are created in line with demand, whenever someone wants to purchase one with their humble dollar.

 

That said, there have been factors that have helped USDC enjoy an explosion in popularity over the years — especially in 2020. One of them is the sudden, sharp rise in the popularity of decentralized finance. USDC is a common sight on many [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) protocols given how it serves as an onramp to the wider ecosystem.


### How Is the USDC Network Secured?

All of the USDCs in circulation are actually ERC-20 tokens, which can be found on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the biggest advantages here is how it can then be integrated with Ethereum-based applications.

Quant,QNT,quant,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3155.png,token,"## What Is Quant (QNT)?

Quant launched in June 2018 with the goal of connecting blockchains and networks on a global scale, without reducing the efficiency and interoperability of the network. It is the first project to solve the interoperability problem through the creation of the first blockchain operating system.

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Quant](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-quant).

The project is built as an operating system distributed ledger technology— and Overledger Network — for connecting different blockchain networks. The project is billed as the first OS to be built for blockchains.

The main aim of Quant — using Overledger — is to bridge the gap that exists between different blockchains. The backbone of the project is the Overledger network, which Quant bills as the ecosystem on which the future digital economy ecosystem will be built. 

Overledger allows developers to build decentralized multi-chain applications (known as MApps) for their customers. For developers to build a Mapp on the network, they must hold a certain amount of Quant tokens (QNT).


### Who Are the Founders of Quant?

Gilbert Verdian, one of the founders of the Quant network, had the idea for the blockchain project while he was working in the healthcare sector. Verdian identified the importance of interoperability in ensuring that patients registered on different platforms are covered.

Verdian has over 20 years of industry experience in upgrading the security, technology and business strategies of businesses around the globe in order to achieve tangible results. 

Prior to the Quant Network, Verdian served as the chief information security officer (CISO) of Vocalink, a Mastercard card company, the chief information officer of NSW Ambulance, the CISO of eHealth NSW, and the security lead of the Ministry of Justice, UK.

The second co-founder, Dr Paolo Tasca, is an entrepreneur, digital economist who specializes in distributed systems. Dr. Tasca has served as the special advisor on blockchain technologies for the EU Parliament, the United Nations and numerous central banks worldwide.

He is also co-author of several books on fintech and is the co-founder and governing board chair of Retail Blockchain Consortium.


## What Makes Quant Unique?

Since the introduction of blockchain and the distributed ledger technology, innovators have found use cases in almost every known industry. However, there has been the problem of seamless interoperability between these projects. Quant was created to be the missing link between the “different” blockchains.

Quant’s operating system, Overledger, was designed to act as a gateway for any blockchain-based project to access all other blockchains. It also works in connecting an application to other applications in the same blockchain ecosystem, like Ethereum.

More than multiple blockchain interactions, Quant creates different layers for apps to interact at different levels. Quant has different layers for transactions, messaging, filtering and ordering, and an application for sharing and referencing identical messages related to other applications.

The Quant App Store has the ability to read and monitor transactions across multiple ledgers. Using Overledger, developers write smart contracts across a wide variety of chains including those that don’t support them — such as Bitcoin. Developers can also use the store to create and release multi-chain applications (MApps).

## How Many Quant (QNT) Tokens Are There in Circulation?

QNT is a utility token. It is a method of payment for Quant services, particularly as a means for Overledger users to pay their fees.

Every client and developer must buy a licence and can use QNT to pay for transactions. This requires tokens to be locked up for 12 months. The cost of running the Gateways and performing read/write operations on Overledger requires the use of the QNT tokens.

The max supply of QNT tokens is set at 14,612,493 tokens. The QNT tokens were split in the following way:



*   9.9 million QNT tokens were sold to the public during the ICO;
*   2.6 million QNT tokens were assigned to the company reserve, to keep the project running;
*   1.3 million QNT tokens were reserved for the company founders;
*   651,000 QNT tokens were issued to the company advisors.

Currently, the circulating supply of the token is 12,072,738 QNT. The extra 2 million tokens are held by the company. These tokens are unlocked and could be sold or issued at any time.


### How Is Quant Secured?

Overledger forms the backbone of the Quant Network. Overledger ensures communicability among DLT networks and interacts with different blockchains.

The Overledger Network includes gateways for linking different blockchains. Similar to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake blockchains, the Quant Network community is involved in handling treasury smart contracts.

The community handles QNT payments flowing from users to the gateways. They do this in a manner where people are held accountable to any observer.

Jones GLP,JGLP,jones-glp,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/23436.png,token,"jGLP is a product of JonesDAO, a protocol that is already listed on CoinGecko. Jones DAO is a yield, strategy, and liquidity protocol for options. We deploy vaults that enable one-click access to institutional-grade options strategies while unlocking capital efficiency & liquidity for DeFi options through yield-bearing options-backed asset tokens. Jones recently launched a set of advanced strategy vaults, jGLP & jUSDC, that are built on top of the GMX platform and GLP.

These vaults deliver transparent and consistent leveraged yield to users. They work in tandem to amplify the yield generated by GLP for depositors.

- jGLP: Smart Leverage on the underlying GLP rewards rate
- jUSDC: Transparent USDC yield without the inefficiencies of competing methods

Both vaults offer optional auto-compounding. Choosing to auto-compound allows users to mint the jGLP and jUSDC receipt tokens. The jGLP vault accrues yield in ETH, while the jUSDC vault accrues yield in USDC.

How do they work?

The jGLP and jUSDC vaults are complementary. At a high level, the two Vaults work together by doing the following:

1. Users can deposit GLP or any GLP basket token into the jGLP Vault, and USDC into the jUSDC Vault.
2. The jGLP Vault borrows USDC collateral from the jUSDC Vault to mint more GLP, thereby gaining leverage on its GLP position.
3. The jGLP Vault delivers amplified and transparent real yield to depositors.
4. The jUSDC Vault delivers USDC yield to depositors by receiving a portion of the yield from the GLP strategy built on its collateral.

The jGLP Vault only borrows from the jUSDC vault, and does not interact with any other leverage sources. jGLP maintains exposure similar to the broad crypto market (i.e ETH, BTC, etc.) while earning multiples of the base GLP yield. Even better, jGLP uses Smart Leverage, developed with extensive backtesting, to automatically rebalance within an algorithmically determined range.","{""website"":[""https://www.jonesdao.io/""],""technical_doc"":[],""explorer"":[""https://arbiscan.io/token/0x7241bc8035b65865156ddb5edef3eb32874a3af6""],""source_code"":[],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/jones-glp""],""chat"":[""https://discord.gg/jonesdao""],""announcement"":[],""reddit"":[],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/JonesDAO_io""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/11841.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x7241bc8035b65865156ddb5edef3eb32874a3af6"",""ContractPlatform"":""Arbitrum"",""ContractPRCURL"":[],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://arbiscan.io/token/0x7241bc8035b65865156ddb5edef3eb32874a3af6""}]",[],[]

Elastos,ELA,elastos,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2492.png,coin,"## What Is Elastos (ELA)?

Elastos aims to be a blockchain-powered version of the internet. The project originates all the way back to the year 2000; however, the current version that is based on blockchain technology and has been in active development by Elastos was founded in June of 2017.

The team behind the project genuinely believe that Ethereum, as well as DApp platforms, face limitations in scaling. While they are great for smart contracts, they are slow, not flexible at all, and inconvenient for full applications, according to Elastos. Elastos is a platform for decentralized apps, or DApps for short, that claims to solve many of these limitations. 

With Elastos, aside from the fact that you gain full ownership over your digital assets, you do not have to access the internet in order to run DApps. All DApps will run on the Smart Web. The idea behind this Smart Web is to protect you from malware and other digital attacks that expose you to data theft. The platform is extremely optimized for mobile and you can run network DApps on every operating system out there.  


## Who Are the Founders of Elastos?

When it comes to the founders of Elastos, the project originated in the year 2000 when founder Rong Chen worked on operating systems at Microsoft Research. He returned to China to develop his own vision, an operating system designed for the entire web. 

Rong Chen was a senior software engineer at Microsoft from 1992 to 2000, after which he founded and was the CTO of Kortide (Beijing), and became the chairman and CEO at Kortide in 2003. In 2017, he became the chairman of the Elastos Foundation.

Later on, when blockchain emerged as a revolutionary technology in 2017, Rong coordinated with Elastos co-founder Feng Han to incorporate blockchain and complete his vision.

Feng Han started out as a mentor at the Tsinghua University, after which he was the principal at the Yuncol School. In 2017 he became the co-founder of Elastos and is currently the founder of MIT IDE Blockchain Pillar and Foundation.


## What Makes Elastos Unique?

Elastos has four pillars that enable network separation as well as platform flexibility. These are blockchain, runtime, carrier and software development kit or SDK.

The blockchain separates app functionality between the main chain and side chains for each individual application.

The runtime gives you the flexibility to run DApps outside of the Elastos operating system all-together. 

The carrier is a peer-to-peer decentralized internet service where you are able to rent out your computational power and storage to other users.

The software development kit connects applications to the Smart Web that is beneficial to non-Elastos applications.

The elastOS application brings the entire decentralized ecosystem into an App.

This flagship product of the Elastos Smartweb has the entire decentralized ecosystem into a single application.

## How Many Elastos (ELA) Coins Are There in Circulation? 

Elastos has a maximum supply of 28,220,000 ELA coins.

Keep in mind that Elastos is actively searching for both new and existing DApp projects throughout its Cyber Republic initiative. 


## How Is the Elastos Network Secured?

When it comes to the security on the Elastos network, all of the communication on the network is encrypted and authorized by blockchain IDs. These IDs in turn determine how the data is processed and who has access to it. Through this system, only the users can choose if they want to sell their data or preserve their privacy. Through a combination of the Elastos Runtime, DApps are provided with trusted network communication.

This means that Elastos is a decentralized internet and DApp platform that gives you, the user, complete control over your digital assets. It's intended to improve the scalability and flexibility issues of other networks as-well, while it is explicitly built for DApp performance. 


## Where Can You Buy Elastos (ELA)?

Currently, you are able to purchase ELA at the following exchanges:

[Bittrex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bittrex/)

[Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/)

[KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/)

PornRocket,PORNROCKET,pornrocket,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/10165.png,token,"## What Is PORNROCKET (PornRocket)?

[PORNROCKET (PornRocket)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pornrocket/) is a native currency of the eponymous adult content sharing platform called NSFW.app built on blockchain. It carries out the ecosystem’s transactions allowing creators to monetize their influence by posting adult pictures and videos, hosting live streams and having one-on-one chats with the fans.

Through the incorporation of blockchain technology PornRocket aims to turn over a new leaf in the way adult entertainment is perceived in media and society. The company believes that their token can become a “bridge currency” in the world of online adult entertainment. 

As stated on the official website https://NSFW.app/ , PORNROCKET token first sale was in May 2021. The company's twitter feed reports that the platform's application NSFW.app currently as of September 2021 is in beta testing and getting ready to go live.


## Who Are the Founders of PORNROCKET?

The founders of PornRocket have not yet revealed their identities. While the project is still in the making, the team has decided to stay anonymous mostly due to security reasons. According to the official web page, the unveiling will take place in the future once the platform hits specific milestones.

The professionals behind PornRocket possess extensive experience in areas such as adult entertainment, fintech, ecommerce, digital marketing and software engineering. 

Reuben Coppa — an entrepreneur with a substantial background in start-ups guidance and blockchain is the strategic advisor of PornRocket. He is also the founder and CEO of intimate.io — a currently owned by PornRocket technology company, focusing on providing cryptocurrency payment solutions for the adult entertainment business. 


## What Makes PORNROCKET Unique?

The introduction of blockchain technology to the online adult entertainment industry allows to eliminate a lot of issues traditionally associated with the field. PornRocket is created to provide anonymous and secure access to adult content for users from around the world. Taking into account the sensitivity of the subject, the safety of the personal information and payment details is a major concern for a lot of industry clients. Blockchain technology makes it possible for users to no longer rely on trust while sharing their private information with service providers.

Since cryptocurrency transactions usually do not require the use of services of traditional financial institutions, the platform claims to be able to abolish the fees paid by creators. Most banks and credit card companies charge the adult entertainment industry high payment processing commissions as they consider the field a high-risk sector. 

Moreover, PornRocket is pointing out that through use of blockchain technology content creators are provided with secure copyright protection since the platform's content can not be stolen and replicated in other media sources.


## How Many PORNROCKET Coins Are There in Circulation?

The total supply is 1 quadrillion tokens. 50% (500 trillion) of the total supply was [burnt](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/burned) Immediately after launch. 5% of each transaction is distributed between the holders respective of the weight they hold. 5% of every transaction is automatically directed to the [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/ru/currencies/pancakeswap/) liquidity pool, locked for 2 years.


## How Is the PORNROCKET Network Secured?

The token is built on [Binance Smart Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-binance-smart-chain) (BSC) — an [EVM-compatible](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) blockchain that runs parallel to [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) blockchain (BC). Unlike BC, BSC is designed to support the creation of smart contracts. Binance Smart Chain uses a proof-of-stake-authority (PoSA) consensus model, a hybrid between [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos#:~:text=Proof%2Dof%2DStake%20involves%20miners,mine%2010%25%20of%20the%20blocks.) and [proof-of-authority](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-authority-poa).

PornRocket is currently planning a deployment of a two-way blockchain bridge between BSC and [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). Since Binance Smart Chain is considered [CeDeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cedefi), a decentralized-by-design ecosystem sees the bridge as an opportunity to achieve more decentralization for the platform.

When Will PORNROCKET Trading Begin?

PORNROCKET was launched In May 2021 on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).


## Can PORNROCKET Hit $0.01?

The initial burn performed shortly after the release triggered the token’s price to spike at the very beginning of the sale reaching at the time $0.0000002444. More recently, in August 2021, as the company began NSFW.app beta testing and announced an upcoming deployment of a two-way blockchain bridge connecting Binance and Ethereum networks, the token price increased once again getting at its highest to $0.000000458. 


## Where Can You Buy PORNROCKET?

PORNROCKET is currently available for purchase on the following exchanges: [PancakeSwap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap-v2/), [LBank](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/lbank/), [Hotbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotbit/), [BitMart](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitmart/) and [ZT](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/zt/).

Karate Combat,KARATE,karate-combat,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/25224.png,token,"Karate (KARATE) is the first token to govern and gamify a real-world professional sports league.  
Karate Combat is a rapidly growing professional full-contact combat sport with 4.6 million followers, 100-200 million organic views per month and approximately 100 exclusive professional athletes.

The league, which was founded by tech and crypto entrepreneurs, targets a young, international demographic through cross-platform distribution, fast stand-up fights, and 3D CGI backgrounds rendered in Unreal Engine.  

The league has televised distribution on many of the world’s top sports networks including Eurosport, Globo’s Canal Combate, BeIN Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN Deportes. The league’s events are simultaneously streamed for free on the league’s own site, Karate.com, as well as Youtube, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook and Kick.

The league employs some of the top karate fighters of all-time and has been built on top of the massive karate brand and lore, but its unique ruleset creates a brand new sport designed to entertain with a fast-paced and differentiated product.  

The UFC (and its copycats) are dominated by jiu jitsu, a sport based on grappling, ground fighting and submission holds. In contrast, Karate Combat’s unique ruleset facilitates a stand-up, striking-based fight event with winners decided by punches, kicks and throws.  Fighters are limited to no more than five seconds of ground and pound on the pit floor.

Each of the league’s events is filmed in front of live-rendered 3D CGI environments using a combination of technologies called In-camera VFX and Extended Reality. The league is the only professional sport filmed in front of live rendered 3D graphics. The end product is a viral, live version of Mortal Kombat.

Karate Combat’s assets were transferred in full in 2022 by its crypto-native founders to an ownerless foundation to enable the KarateDAO to facilitate web3 governance and gamification.  The new structure enables a web3 game tailored exactly to the habits and interests of sports fans.
Beyond real governance of the league, the primary initial utility for the KARATE token is to play Up Only Gaming.  Up Only Gaming is a no-loss game built on smart contracts. When sports fans have a wager on an event, even a small one, engagement is an order of magnitude higher. However, the reality is that most people inevitably stop betting on sports because they lose their money.
The innovative Up Only Gaming mobile and webapps allow token holders to frictionlessly pick their favorite fighters for the chance to earn more tokens with no risk of loss. For 48 hours before each event, token holders can vote for fighters using off-chain signed messages. Players can allocate all of their votes to 1 fight or split votes up amongst multiple fights. The more $KARATE tokens a player has, the more they can win.  Players who vote for losing fighters retain their $KARATE tokens to play again next time.  Over time active players and winning fighters slowly dilute inactive fans.
The league has also fully embraced a web3 open ecosystem go-to-market strategy by way of an incredibly permissive IP license, initially in the categories of NFTs & video games.  The league will also be open sourcing its smart contracts and front ends, to foster a vibrant ecosystem of applications built on top of the Up Only Gaming primitives.

To date most fan tokens and sports NFT projects have relied on token-gated experiences to drive utility. This is table stakes, and with the entire league governed by the token, Karate Combat can do it 10x better.  Karate Combat believes that a transparent public ledger is the perfect technology to enable a shared feeling of ownership of a cultural asset like a sports property and intends to utilize it in full.","{""website"":[""https://www.karate.com/"",""https://www.karate.com/app""],""technical_doc"":[""https://www.karate.com/whitepaper""],""explorer"":[""https://etherscan.io/token/0x80008BCD713c38AF90a9930288D446bc3bD2E684"",""https://hashscan.io/mainnet/token/0.0.2283230""],""source_code"":[],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/karate-combat""],""chat"":[""https://discord.gg/karatecombat""],""announcement"":[],""reddit"":[""https://reddit.com/r/KarateCombat""],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/KarateCombat""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1027.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x80008BCD713c38AF90a9930288D446bc3bD2E684"",""ContractPlatform"":""Ethereum"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://etherscan.io/token/0x80008BCD713c38AF90a9930288D446bc3bD2E684""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/4642.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0.0.2283230"",""ContractPlatform"":""Hedera Hashgraph"",""ContractPRCURL"":[],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://hashscan.io/mainnet/token/0.0.2283230""}]",[],[]

Ravencoin,RVN,ravencoin,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2577.png,coin,"## What Is Ravencoin (RVN)?

Ravencoin is a digital peer-to-peer ([P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p)) network that aims to implement a use case specific blockchain, designed to efficiently handle one specific function: the transfer of assets from one party to another. Built on a fork of the [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) code, Ravencoin was announced on Oct. 31, 2017 and released binaries for mining on Jan. 3, 2018 with what is called a fair launch: no premine, ICO or masternodes. It was named in reference to a TV show Game of Thrones.


### Who Are the Founders of Ravencoin?

The Ravencoin whitepaper was published by Bruce Fenton, Tron Black and Joel Weight.

They stand out over the majority of the crypto crowd in that they were all seasoned businessmen and developers before they started this project.

Fenton is well known in crypto for being a board member and an executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation from 2015 to 2018. Before crypto, he had a solid career in investment banking as the vice president of Morgan Stanley in the 90s and a managing director of Atlantis Consulting for 13 years. Currently, he works as a managing director of Chainstone Labs, a stealth fintech startup.

Tron Black is a principal software developer with more than 30 years of experience, including leading several software companies as a CEO. He has been working in crypto since 2013 on several ventures including Verified Wallet, CoinCPA and t0. He is currently employed with Medici Ventures, a subsidiary of Overstock.com focused on blockchain technology applications.

Weight is a chief technology officer at Overstock.com, a well known online retailer. Previously, he has also been involved with Medici Ventures in roles of COO and CTO. He is a veteran software developer who started his career after graduating from the University of Utah in 1998 right in the middle of the dotcom bubble.


#### What Makes Ravencoin Unique?

As a fork of the Bitcoin code, Ravencoin features four key changes: modified issuance schedule (with block reward of 5,000 RVN), block time reduced to one minute, coin supply capped at 21 billion (a thousand times more than BTC) and a mining algorithm (KAWPOW, formerly X16R and X16RV2 respectively) intended to mitigate the centralization of mining caused by ASIC hardware. 

Ravencoin aimsto solve the problem of assets transfer and trading over blockchain. Previously, if someone created an asset on the Bitcoin blockchain, it could be accidentally destroyed when someone traded the coins it was created with. 

RVN coins are designed as internal currency within the network and must be burnt in order to issue token assets on the Ravenchain. The assets can represent anything: real world custodial objects like gold or physical euros, virtual goods and objects, a share of a project like stocks and securities, airline miles or an hour of someone’s wage, etc. 

The planned future versions of Ravencoin protocol will support integrated messaging and voting systems.

#### How Many Ravencoin (RVN) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Ravencoin insists on being  as fair and open as it is possible for a new cryptocurrency. There was no pre-mine, no ICO and no coins were held for developer or founders rewards.

In three years since its inception (as of March 2021), 39% of coins are already mined. The total supply is capped at 21 billion coins.


### How Is the Ravencoin Network Secured?

Ravencoin is a fork of Bitcoin, so it is protected by the power of decentralization and mathematics. It uses a proof-of-work mining algorithm called KAWPOW, which replaced X16R and X16RV2 on May 6, 2020. Not only does this ensure security it is designed to be ASIC resistant. 

The X16r algorithm group employed initially uses 16 different hashing algorithms for each mining block, but the order in which they are used is different for every block and is derived from the last 8 bytes of the hash of the previous block. It was thought that the necessity to adapt each cycle did not give ASICs any advantage over CPUs and GPUs. Eventually, however, ASICs for it were created, andRavencoin had to switch to an entirely different algorithm, KAWPOW, which was a slightly modified version of ProgPow, which itself was the evolution of Ethash and is optimised for mining on GPUs.

This, combined with the commitment of fair distribution with no pre-mine is meant to ensure that no single individual or organization will have or be able to have enough hash power to try to attempt a 51% attack or create any sort of artificial market price shocks.

Unfortunately, there was a successful known hack of the Ravencoin blockchain, of which the public was informed about on June 3, 2020. During the attack, hackers managed to instantly  mint i315 million RVN coins, which constitutes about 1.5% of Ravencoin’s supply cap of 21 billion. At the moment of the announcement, the price of the stolen RVN was estimated at USD $5.7M. None of the existing coin holders were directly affected by the attack.


### Where Can You Buy Ravencoin (RVN)?

RVN is a freely traded coin with pairs against stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT), other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and fiat money.

The top exchanges for trading in Ravencoin are currently [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/), [ZG.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/zg-com/), and [VCC Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/vcc-exchange/).

Polkadot,DOT,polkadot-new,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/6636.png,coin,"## **What Is Polkadot (DOT)?**

Polkadot is an [open-source sharded multichain protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-polkadot) that connects and secures a network of specialized blockchains, facilitating cross-chain transfer of any data or asset types, not just tokens, thereby allowing blockchains to be interoperable with each other. Polkadot was designed to provide a foundation for a decentralized internet of blockchains, also known as Web3.

Polkadot is known as a layer-0 metaprotocol because it underlies and describes a format for a network of layer 1 blockchains known as parachains (parallel chains). As a metaprotocol, Polkadot is also capable of autonomously and forklessly updating its own codebase via on-chain governance according to the will of its token holder community.

Polkadot provides a foundation to support a decentralized web, controlled by its users, and to simplify the creation of new applications, institutions and services.

The Polkadot protocol can connect public and private chains, permissionless networks, oracles and future technologies, allowing these independent blockchains to trustlessly share information and transactions through the Polkadot Relay Chain (explained further down).

Polkadot’s native DOT token serves three clear purposes: staking for operations and security, facilitating network governance, and bonding tokens to  connect parachains .

Polkadot has four core components:

* Relay Chain: Polkadot’s “heart,” helping to create consensus, interoperability and shared security across the network of different chains;
* [Parachains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-parachain-slot-auctions-and-crowdloans): independent chains that can have their own tokens and be optimized for specific use cases;
* Parathreads: similar to parachains but with flexible connectivity based on an economical pay-as-you-go model;
* Bridges: allow parachains and parathreads to connect and communicate with external blockchains like Ethereum.

### **Who Are the Founders of Polkadot?**

Polkadot is the flagship protocol of Web3 Foundation, a Swiss Foundation with a mission to facilitate an open-source, fully functional and user-friendly decentralized web.

Polkadot’s founders are Dr. Gavin Wood, Robert Habermeier and Peter Czaban.

Wood, Web3 Foundation’s president, is the most well-known of the trio thanks to his industry influence as Ethereum co-founder, Parity Technologies founder and the creator of the smart contract coding language Solidity. Wood is also credited with coining the term Web3.

Habermeier is a Thiel Fellow and accomplished blockchain and cryptography researcher and developer. Czaban is the former Technology Director at Web3 Foundation, with a wealth of experience across highly specialized fintech industries.

### **What Makes Polkadot Unique?**

Polkadot is a sharded multichain network, meaning it can process many transactions on several chains in parallel (“parachains”). This parallel processing power improves scalability.

Custom blockchains are quick and easy to develop using the Substrate framework and Substrate blockchains are designed to be easy to connect to Polkadot's network. The network is also highly flexible and adaptive, allowing the sharing of information and functionality between participants. Polkadot can be automatically upgraded without the need for a fork in order to implement new features or remove bugs.

The network has a highly sophisticated user-driven governance system where all token holders have a vote in how the network is run. Teams can customize their own blockchain’s governance on Polkadot based on their needs and evolving conditions. Nominators, validators, and collators all fulfil various duties to help secure and maintain the network and eradicate bad behavior.

At the end of 2021, Polkadot successfully concluded its first [Parachain auctions](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/polkadot-parachain-auctions-go-live). The Parachain auctions followed an un-permissioned candle auction system. The winning bid is the highest bid at the random moment the auction ends. 

Polkadot assigned the first five slots to the following auction winners: [Acala](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/acala/), [Moonbeam](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moonbeam/), [Astar](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astar/), [Parallel](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/parallel-finance/) and [Clover](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/clover/). These projects will have their parachain slots locked in for 96 weeks, guaranteed by the DOT bidders committed as collateral. As customary on Polkadot, all projects had previously been battle-tested on its de-facto testnet [Kusama](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kusama/). 

## Polkadot's New On-Chain Governance Model

Announced in June 2022, the protocol is set to overhaul the existing framework so that the network will become more entrenched in the [decentralization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized) ethos. The team argued that the current [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) system has elements of centralization. For example, the Polkadot Council, a body of executives, had sole control over some decision-making processes, including how the network's treasury is spent.

To this end, the new development is replacing the existing governance infrastructure with a framework in the form of a ""referendum."" In other words, the planned upgrade will introduce a voting system allowing anyone to submit proposals and have them approved. 

Called Governorship version 2 or Gov2, this upgrade allegedly eliminates all forms of preferential first-class citizenry like the Technical Committee and the Polkadot Council.

With this, the protocol aims to reduce the concentration of voting power by replacing the Technical Committee with the Polkadot Fellowship, designed to accommodate up to tens of thousands of members and feature a lower barrier for entry. The members are ranked to showcase the degree the protocol expects each participant to make informed decisions and support proposals that are in the best interest of the network. 

Another core component of the upgrade is the Origins and Tracks system. This mechanism will help grade the importance of a proposal and determine the appropriate way to treat them. As such, the network can implement suitable safeguards to ensure that the decision-making process is decentralized and fair. For instance, proposals tagged as Root Origins are the most sensitive. Such proposals undergo longer and more scrutinized consideration periods, with a higher approval threshold. Also, the system ensures that only one hypersensitive proposal can be deliberated on at a time.

On the other hand, proposals with less sensitive Origins have shorter consideration periods with a lower approval threshold. Put simply, the grade of the importance of proposals will determine the type of safeguards assigned to them and the length of the decision-making process they undergo.

Gov2 will first be tested on [Kusama](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kusama/), an experimental development environment for testing applications, before it goes live on Polkadot. Once the testing and audit phase is complete, the team will submit the proposal to launch Gov2 on the Polkadot network.

#### **How Many Polkadot (DOT) Tokens Are There in Circulation?**

Following the [network’s redenomination](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/redenomination) after a referendum on Polkadot, DOT balances increased by 100, so one old DOT was equivalent to 100 new DOT. This meant that the initial maximum supply of 10 million old DOT in August 2020 became 1 billion new DOT tokens. The redenomination was undertaken purely to avoid the use of small decimals and make calculation easier. While all balances were increased by a factor of one hundred, this did not impact the distribution of DOT or holders’ proportional share.

Polkadot’s first initial coin offering (ICO) was held in October 2017, and the Polkadot price was $0.29, with 2.24 million tokens offered. The second ICO was held in July 2020, and the Polkadot price offered was $1.25, and 342,080 DOT tokens were sold.

### **How Is the Polkadot Network Secured?**

The network uses an NPoS (nominated proof-of-stake) mechanism with  validators and nominators.Nominators back validators with their tokens. These staked tokens maximize chain security by making it prohibitively expensive to misbehave.

Validators are staked on the Relay Chain and confirm transactions coming from the different parachains. This unique validity scheme enables chains to interact with each other securely under the same rules, yet remain independently governed.

### **Where Can You Buy Polkadot (DOT)?**

The top exchanges for Polkadot (DOT) trading are currently [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/), [Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/), [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/) and more.

## What Is Stacks (STX)?

Stacks is a Bitcoin Layer for smart contracts; it enables smart contracts and decentralized applications to use Bitcoin as an asset and settle transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin is the largest, most valuable, and most durable decentralized asset. The Stacks layer unlocks $500B in BTC capital using the Bitcoin L1 as settlement for decentralized applications. 

Stacks has knowledge of the full Bitcoin state, thanks to its Proof of Transfer consensus and Clarity language, enabling it to read from Bitcoin at any time. 

All transactions on the Stacks layer are automatically hashed and settled on the Bitcoin L1. Stacks blocks are secured by 100% Bitcoin hashpower. In order to re-order Stacks blocks/transactions, an attacker would have to reorg Bitcoin. 


### Who Are the Founders of Stacks?

The project started in 2017 when Muneeb finished his PhD ([his thesis laid out the foundations for the Stacks layer for Bitcoin](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/research/techreps/TR-003-17&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1678030902432250&usg=AOvVaw3GPZe_ECpyHTAy5YfG5GDL)), released the original whitepaper, and raised $50M. Before this, the early team built protocols and apps on Bitcoin L1 before they began working on Stacks in 2017. Some early visions of the project are represented in this TEDx talk.

In 2019 there was the first-ever SEC qualified token offering ([see WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-clears-blockstack-to-hold-first-regulated-token-offering-11562794848)) for the general public, including the US. The [full offering material](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1719379/000110465919020748/a18-15736_1partiiandiii.html) disclosed everything and anything about the project/company/people.

2018-2020 the team was heads down building out the Stacks infrastructure— it's a programming layer for Bitcoin (it works like a blockchain with cross-chain consensus with Bitcoin) and Clarity lang, a safe language. Some technical re[sources are here](https://https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks).

#### What Makes Stacks Unique?

* As a Bitcoin layer for smart contracts, Stacks has the following innovations that make it unique: 
* In the upcoming release of Stacks, Stacks will be secured by the entire hash power of Bitcoin, giving it Bitcoin finality. 
* Stacks will soon have a novel backed Bitcoin that is 1:1 backed with BTC on Bitcoin L1, and can be moved in and out of the Stacks layer in a decentralized way.
* The new 1:1 Bitcoin backed asset called sBTC enables Stacks smart contracts to write to Bitcoin. 
* Stacks powers atomic BTC swaps and assets owned by BTC addresses. 
* Stacks uses the Clarity programming language for safe, decidable contracts. 
* Stacks has knowledge of the full Bitcoin state, thanks to Proof of Transfer and Clarity, enabling it to read from Bitcoin at any time. 
* Lastly, Stacks is a scalable layer that enables fast transactions that settle on Bitcoin.

#### How Many Stacks (STX) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The Stacks cryptocurrency has a predefined future supply that reaches approx 1,818M STX by year 2050. The Stacks ecosystem is a collection of independent entities, developers, and community members working to build a user-owned internet on Bitcoin. No entity in the space holds >10% of the circulating STX supply. Even the early investors/entities generally hold less than 5%. These stats are self-reported and from on-chain data and naturally update over time.

### How Is the Stacks Network Secured?

Stacks uses the Bitcoin blockchain as its base layer. As a [Proof of Work (PoW)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)-based blockchain, Bitcoin uses the combined efforts of thousands of miners and nodes to protect the network against [attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack) by making it computationally and economically unfeasible to subvert the network. 

On top of this, Stacks introduces its own consensus model, known as proof-of-transfer (PoX), which is a novel mining mechanism that sees users transfer the base currency (BTC) to mine STX — effectively bootstrapping the security of the Stacks blockchain using BTC. 


### Where Can You Buy Stacks (STX)?

STX is available to trade on several prominent exchange platforms, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/),Coinbase, Kraken, Upbit, and KuCoin. For a full list of available trading pairs and supported platforms, see the [markets section](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/markets/).

Fantom,FTM,fantom,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3513.png,coin,"## What Is Fantom (FTM)?

Fantom is a directed acyclic graph ([DAG](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/directed-acyclic-graph-dag)) smart contract platform providing decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) services to developers using its own bespoke consensus algorithm.

Together with its in-house token FTM, Fantom aims to solve problems associated with smart-contract platforms, specifically transaction speed, which developers say they have reduced to under two seconds. 

The Fantom Foundation, which oversees the Fantom product offering, was originally created in 2018, with the launch of OPERA, Fantom’s mainnet, coming in December 2019.

Fantom is an open-source decentralized smart contract platform for [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) and digital assets that was created as an alternative to [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). Fantom has the goal of overcoming the limitations of previous generation blockchains and balancing three components: scalability, security and decentralization. The project offers a set of tools to simplify the process of integrating existing DApps, as well as a detailed staking reward system and built-in [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) instruments.

Fantom is a Layer-1 blockchain that uses a scratch-built consensus mechanism and independent consensus layer, Lachesis, to facilitate DeFi and related services on the basis of smart contracts. Lachesis provides security for other layers as well, including Opera, Fantom's EVM-compatible [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) chain. The long-playing mission of the project is to “grant compatibility between all transaction bodies around the world.”

One of Fantom's key strengths is its performance and efficient transaction processing, namely thousands of transactions per second, where transactions are settled in 1-2 seconds, and the cost is fractions of a cent per transaction. As a result, Fantom provides higher scalability but at a lower cost.

The ecosystem is based on two main technologies: Lachesis protocol and Opera.

The Lachesis protocol is the core consensus layer that secures the Fantom network by providing both transaction speed and security.

Lachesis is an aBFT consensus engine that uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) algorithm. How it works: network data can be processed at different times, and the network filters the participants, allowing only one third, which are allocated due to erroneous or malicious behavior, without compromising network processes.

Fantom's Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (aBFT) Proof-of-Stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) consensus mechanism maintains the efficiency of the entire network, its design provides security at maximum speed. Fantom developers emphasize that the PoS mechanism is a leaderless phenomenon — there are no leaders of blocks and participants, and anyone can join (or leave) the network of nodes at a convenient moment.

The key qualities of Lachesis are: asynchronous, leaderless, Byzantine fault-tolerant, and near-instant finality.

As for Opera, it's an application development layer or Fantom's mainnet deployment platform, permissionless and open-source hosting DApps. Thanks to EVM integration and support for the Solidity programming language, Fantom has a full set of smart contract capabilities, which allows users to seamlessly interact with Ethereum platforms while maintaining the advantage of Fantom's transaction efficiency.

The Fantom Foundation concluded that removing block leaders improves network security, so Opera uses a PoS model and leaderless validators (validators do not determine which blocks are valid).

In addition to being a fast, secure and cheap payment platform that enables to make fast and secure payments at minimal cost, Fantom also features on-chain governance where users vote with FTM tokens (one token equals one vote). Of the features: users have the right to express the degree of agreement / disagreement on a scale from 0 to 4.

FTM is the native utility in-house PoS token of Fantom that powers the [ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-fantom-a-guide-to-fantom-s-ecosystem) and is applied for payments, network fees, staking, and governance. FTM forms the backbone of transactions, and allows fee collection and staking activities, along with the user rewards the latter represents.

### Who Are the Founders of Fantom?

The Fantom Foundation was founded by South Korean computer scientist Dr. Ahn Byung Ik. Currently, the platform’s CEO is Michael Kong.

The team behind Fantom has extensive experience primarily in the field of full-stack blockchain development, and aimed to create a smart contract platform which privileges scalability, decentralization and security.

According to its official website, Fantom’s team also consists of specialist engineers, scientists, researchers, designers and entrepreneurs. Employees are located throughout the world, matching the ethos of a distributed platform. 


#### What Makes Fantom Unique?

Fantom attempts to use a new scratch-built consensus mechanism to facilitate DeFi and related services on the basis of smart contracts.

The mechanism, Lachesis, promises much higher capacity and two-second transaction finalization, along with improvements to security over traditional [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoS) algorithm-based platforms.

Matching [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), the project appeals to developers looking to deploy decentralized solutions. According to its official literature, its mission is to “grant compatibility between all transaction bodies around the world.”

Its in-house PoS token, FTM, forms the backbone of transactions, and allows fee collection and staking activities, along with the user rewards the latter represents.

Through token sales in 2018, Fantom raised almost $40 million to fund development.

##### How Many Fantom (FTM) Coins Are There In Circulation?

FTM is a proof-of-stake (PoS) token which in fact exists in several incarnations. 

The platform’s compatibility with Ethereum means that users can purchase an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) standard FTM, which is automatically converted to native FTM once received to their wallet. Another version of FTM is available on Binance Chain using its BEP2 standard. Only the native FTM can be used on the Fantom OPERA mainnet itself.

The total supply of FTM is 3.175 billion tokens, of which 2,134,638,448 FTM is currently in circulation. The rest will be released subject to a schedule running through 2023.

Staking forms an important part of tokenomics, with a proportion of the supply reserved specifically for staking rewards to users who hold FTM.


#### How Is the Fantom Network Secured?

Fantom uses a bespoke variety of proof-of-stake algorithm to provide services and secure its network. Known as Lachesis, it is an example of a so-called asynchronous byzantine fault tolerant (aBFT) consensus mechanism.

By removing leadership among network participants, Fantom avoids low-cost attack risk, while staking adds further user incentives to secure operations using FTM token holdings.


#### Where Can You Buy Fantom (FTM)?

Fantom’s FTM token is freely tradeable, and can be found on major exchanges such as Binance, Gate.io and OKEx Korea. 

FTM exists on several protocols, with ERC-20, BEP2 and Fantom’s own OPERA tokens all circulating.

Maker,MKR,maker,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1518.png,token,"## What Is Maker (MKR)?

Maker (MKR) is the governance token of the MakerDAO and Maker Protocol — respectively a [decentralized organization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) and a software platform, both based on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain — that allows users to issue and manage the DAI stablecoin.

Initially conceived in 2015 and fully launched in December 2017, Maker is a project whose task is to operate DAI, a community-managed decentralized cryptocurrency with a stable value soft-pegged to the US dollar.

MKR tokens act as a kind of voting share for the organization that manages DAI; while they do not pay dividends to their holders, they do give the holders voting rights over the development of Maker Protocol and are expected to appreciate in value in accordance with the success of DAI itself.

The Maker ecosystem is one of the earliest projects on the decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) scene: the industry that seeks to build decentralized financial products on top of smart-contract-enabled blockchains, such as Ethereum.


### Who Are the Founders of Maker?

MakerDAO, the first entity inside the larger Maker ecosystem, was created in 2015 by Rune Christensen, an entrepreneur from Sealand, Denmark.

Christensen graduated from Copenhagen University with a degree in biochemistry and studied international business at the Copenhagen Business School. Prior to MakerDAO, he co-founded and managed the Try China international recruiting company.


#### What Makes Maker Unique?

As of October 2020, DAI is one of the most popular stablecoins (cryptocurrencies whose prices are pegged to the USD or another traditional currency). It is the 25th largest cryptocurrency at over $800 million in market capitalization and it has more active addresses than USDT — the largest stablecoin on the market.

MKR’s unique proposition lies in the fact that it allows its holders to directly participate in the process of governing DAI. Every holder of Maker tokens has the right to vote on a number of changes to the Maker Protocol, with their voting power depending on the size of their MKR stake. Some of the aspects of the protocol the holders can vote on are:

* Adding new collateral asset types to the protocol, allowing users to submit new cryptocurrencies to mint more DAI;
* Amend the risk parameters of existing collateral asset types;
* Change the DAI Savings Rate: holders of DAI tokens can earn savings by locking them in a special contract, and the Savings Rate impacts the profitability of that contract;
*   Choose the oracles — entities whose goal is to supply trustworthy off-blockchain data to the Maker ecosystem;
* Upgrades to the platform.

This ability to participate in the management of one of the largest stablecoins on the market is what drives the demand for MKR tokens and correspondingly affects their value.

#### How Many Maker [MKR] Coins Are There in Circulation?

The issuance and removal of MKR from the system is governed by a complex system of interdependent mechanisms designed to ensure that DAI is always fully collateralized by other cryptocurrency assets and its soft peg to the USD is maintained. There is no hard-coded limit on the total supply of MKR.

DAI’s value is secured by collateral — other cryptocurrencies that are deposited by users when minting new DAI tokens and stored in so-called vaults — [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) on the Ethereum blockchain.

During price downswings, the value of crypto stored in the vault might become insufficient to fully collateralize the corresponding amount of DAI. In that case, the Maker Protocol automatically initiates the liquidation of the vault’s contents, the proceeds of which it uses to cover that vault’s obligations. If the amount of DAI generated during the liquidation is not enough, the Maker Protocol mints new MKR tokens to sell and cover the remaining sum, thereby increasing the total supply.

However, in some cases, the amount of DAI made from the auctions exceeds the necessary limit to ensure full collateralizations — then, it is used by the Maker Protocol to buy back and burn MKR tokens, decreasing their total supply.

Thus, the supply of MKR is a dynamic value that changes depending on market conditions and the overall health of the DAI ecosystem. As of October 2020, the circulating supply of Maker tokens is about 1 million, worth more than $500 million.


### How Is the Maker Network Secured?

MKR is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, meaning that it runs on and is secured by the Ethereum [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain). Ethereum, in turn, is secured by its Ethash [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) function.


### Where Can You Buy Maker (MKR)?

Maker token trading is available on such exchanges as:

THORChain,RUNE,thorchain,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/4157.png,token,"## What Is THORChain (RUNE)?
 
THORChain is a decentralized liquidity protocol that allows users to easily exchange cryptocurrency assets across a range of networks without losing full custody of their assets in the process.
 
With THORChain, users can simply swap one asset for another in a permissionless setting, without needing to rely on order books to source liquidity. Instead, market prices are maintained through the ratio of assets in a pool (see [automated market maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm#:~:text=An%20automated%20market%20maker%20(AMM,operates%20in%20through%20automated%20trading.)).
 
The native utility token of the THORChain platform is RUNE. This is used as the base currency in the THORChain ecosystem and is also used for platform governance and security as part of THORChain's Sybil resistance mechanisms — since THORChain nodes must commit a minimum of 1 million 300k RUNE to participate in its rotating [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) process.
 
THORChain was funded through an initial DEX offering (IDO) which launched through the Binance [DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) in July 2019. Its single-chain chaosnet launched in April 2021, the multi-chain upgrade was launched in April 2021 and Mainnet is now live as of Jun 2022..

### Who Are the Founders of THORChain?
 
According to an official representative of THORChain, the platform has no CEO, no founder and no directors. Instead, the further development of the protocol is organized via Gitlab with nodes as the ultimate deciders of which codebase to run.
 
Those currently working on the project are largely anonymous. Again, an official representative of THORChain states that this is to ""protect the project and ensure that it can decentralize.""
 
A [tweet](https://twitter.com/thorchain_org/status/1198720787785453568?lang=en) by the project sheds some light on the theory behind maintaining a project with an anonymous team, as quoted below:
 
“-> Developers work for the Nodes, by shipping code that makes the system more valuable.
 
-> Nodes work for the, liquidity providers by securing assets and being online.
 
->  Liquidity providers bring capital, placed on-market for the Swappers and arbitrageurs.

THORChain uses a unique system to help mitigate the issue of [“impermanent losses”](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss) — or the often temporary losses that a liquidity provider can experience when contributing to liquidity pools. It achieves this by using a slip-based fee to help ensure liquidity stays where it is needed.

THORChain combines a range of novel technologies, including on-way state pegs, a state machine, the Bifröst Signer Module and a TSS protocol to seamlessly facilitate cross-chain token swaps permissionlessly. This is all kept behind the scenes, making the platform accessible to even inexperienced traders. 

The protocol isn't profit-oriented. All fees generated by the protocol go directly to the participants eg. node operators and liquidity providers, and there are no provisions for the team. Instead, the team is incentivized by simply holding RUNE — just like everyone else.

The RUNE token is currently available on multiple blockchains, including Binance Chain (as a BEP-2 token) and Ethereum (as an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token) however support will end or these in favour for [Native RUNE](https://medium.com/thorchain/upgrading-to-native-rune-a9d48e0bf40f)

#### How Many THORChain (RUNE) Coins Are There in Circulation?

As of June 2022, there are 308.0 million RUNE in circulation out of a total supply of 500 million.

As we touched on earlier, THORChain initially launched following an [IDO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-exchange-offering) on the Binance DEX. As part of the IDO, 20 million RUNE were sold. Prior to this, a total of 130 million RUNE were sold in earlier funding rounds. 

According to the official [Binance DEX proposal](https://community.binance.org/topic/357/proposal-to-list-thorchain-rune-on-binance-dex), 10% of the total supply (50 million tokens) was allocated to the team, and locked until the launch of the mainnet — unlocking at 20% per month thereafter. Much of this allocation was on-sold to raise further funds for the protocol. The team own less than 1% of all RUNE.

### How Is the THORChain Network Secured?

THORChain is built using the Cosmos SDK and is powered by the Tendermint consensus mechanism. This keeps the network safe from [attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack) through a novel [BFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft) proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) system that sees a large number of validators work together to propose and finalize blocks of transactions. 

Beyond this, THORChain’s [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) have been audited by several third-party security firms, including one by Certik — which found no vulnerabilities. 


### Where Can You Buy THORChain (RUNE)?

RUNE is a popular cryptocurrency that is available to purchase and trade on a large number of both centralized and decentralized exchange platforms. The most prominent of these are [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) (centralized) and THORChain interfaces found at [THORSwap](https://docs.thorchain.org/ecosystem#exchanges-only) (decentralized). 

As of June 2022, the vast majority of RUNE trading pairs are crypto/crypto pairs. However, RUNE can be bought with Korean won (KRW) on ProBit Exchange and US dollars (USD) on Binance.

CREDIT,CREDIT,credit,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/4165.png,coin,"**What is Credit (CREDIT)?** 
Credit is Web3 without the Fee. That's why ee designed Credit Smartchain to be the Hyper-Fast and virtually free EVM blockchain that can process 100,000 transactions per second. Credit is not only fast but it can also support the low Gas fee of $0.0000000017 well into the forseeable future.

**Fast & Scalable**
100,000 Transactions per second & 3s block intervals

**Decentralized**
Highly decentralized with over 30 globally decentralized validator nodes

**Zero Fee**
Zero real world cost gas fee of $0.0000000017

**Ecosystem**
Fast & Cheap, but most all Decentralized.
Credit Project is a decentralized blockchain development team, since 2018 we have been building the ultimate Smartchain. We call it CREDIT and it makes the advancement and widespread adoption of Web3 much more likely, because it is extremely fast and virtually free.

CREDIT is EVM-compatible, so it launched with support for the rich universe of Ethereum tools and DApps. In theory, this makes it easy for developers and teams to port their projects over from Ethereum and other EVM networks.

**The Ultimate In Decentralization**
100% safe from bad actors, we harness the power of PoA to secure our decentralization with over 30 community owned validator nodes. Our validators are well established within the community and have been supporters for many years, they are deeply bonded and expect an equal commitment from prospective validators.

**Community**
What began in 2018 has grown into a global community. We leverage the best ideas generated by our passionate members and put them into action quickly to maximise the benefit of all new developments. A more diverse and globally distributed community is hard to find in crypto, we are all focussed on adoption at grass roots level with many of our members being first time crypto users. We all help each other.

**Zero Fee Reality**
The possibility for growth in all sectors is multiplied immessurably when you remove the cost, which has historically been the most limiting factor for wide spread adoption. CREDIT solved the Gas problem. If we consider all the possible uses and benenfits blockchain, smartcontracts and decentralization can bring to people and businesses, then it's easy to see how the cost associated with use has limited the growth of Web3, DeFi and NFT.

**Virtually Zero Cost**
The Fast & Cheap Blockchain
Credit works just like any other Ethereum blockchain, users need to pay Gas to on every transaction. Gas is important because it protects the network from abuse. We have the same Gas as other more expensive chains but we have virtually no cost. We used completely new technology to scale the speed and cost of Web3 well into the forseeable future.

You can make a lifetime of transactions, 47,901, for just 1 CREDIT ($0.0000000017)

**Who is behind the project ?**
The Credit Project began in 2018 and was founded by Daniele Marco Ronchese, who is the current CEO & CTO. The Credit team has been developed from the community and over time has grown into a diverse and globally distributed body of volunteers.

Axie Infinity,AXS,axie-infinity,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/6783.png,token,"## **What Is Axie Infinity (AXS)?**

Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that is partially owned and operated by its players.

To learn more about this project, check out our [deep dive of Axie Infinity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-axie-infinity).

Inspired by popular games like Pokémon and Tamagotchi, Axie Infinity allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as Axies.

These Axies can take various forms, and there are more than 500 different body parts available, including aquatic, beast, bird, bug, plant and reptile parts. Parts from each type class come in four different rarity scales: common, rare, ultra rare and legendary — and Axies can have any combination of body parts, making them highly variable and often rare and unique.

Each Axie is a [non-fungible token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) (NFT) with different attributes and strengths and can be entered into 3v3 battles, with the winning team earning more experience (exp) points that are used to level up an Axie's stats or evolve their body parts. These Axies can be bred together to produce new and unique offspring, which can be used or sold on the Axie marketplace.

The Axie Infinity ecosystem also has its own unique [governance token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token), known as Axie Infinity Shards (AXS). These are used to participate in key governance votes and will give holders a say in how funds in the Axie Community Treasury are spent.


### **Who Are the Founders of Axie Infinity?**

Axie Infinity was created in 2018 by Sky Mavis — a technology-focused game developer with a team primarily based in Vietnam. It was co-founded by Trung Nguyen and Aleksander Larsen.

Trung Nguyen is the current CEO of the platform. Nguyen graduated with a BS in computer software engineering, and worked as a software engineer at Anduin Transactions prior to founding Axie Infinity.

Former competitive gamer Aleksander Larsen is also credited as a co-founder and COO of the platform. Larsen has been working in [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) gaming since 2017. He previously worked as the executive security officer for the Norwegian Government Security Organization and still sits as Secretary of the Board of Directors at the Blockchain Game Alliance.

In total, the Axie Infinity team consists of 25 full-time employees — many of whom have experience with game development.


#### **What Makes Axie Infinity Unique?**

Each Axie possesses six out of the hundreds of different potential body parts — each of which has its own battle move. This produces essentially endless variety among Axies, with most Axies having relatively weak statistics, while those with the strongest combination of body parts can have incredible stats.

Unlike some other blockchain-based battling and breeding games, each Axie can only be bred a total of seven times to help control the population of Axies.

Axie Infinity has its own mating hub to help players find a suitable match to breed their Axie with to stand the best chance at producing a rare or powerful offspring. It costs 0.005 ETH in addition to Small Love Potion (SLP) tokens to breed Axies.

AXS token holders will soon be able to [stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) their tokens to receive regular rewards. But unlike some other stakeable assets, AXS holders will also need to vote and play to claim their rewards.

### Axie Infinity Gameplay

Axie Infinity invites users to earn tokens through all sorts of aspects of gameplay. It also allows players to breed, grow and trade ecosystem game characters aka non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – Axie creatures. Those virtual pets have their own class, particular characteristics and a set of attributes. Axies are collectible and can also be sold on the in-game marketplace called [P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p) Axie. 

Axies are made up of a set of stats as class and body parts, indicating their features and rarity level. Distinctive ability cards that are directly related to a configuration of characteristics are the center of the gameplay. Each Axie is a unique NFT owned and controlled by its user.


### Play-to-Earn Model

Axie Infinity is one of the pioneers of the [Play-to-Earn](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/play-to-earn-play2earn) (P2E) concept, where gamers earn crypto and NFTs through gaming activity. As part of the online game, users participate in turn-based battles, but the main difference is that gamers have control over their characters, land plots, resources and other in-game items of the universe. Thus, Axie Infinity is an open digital universe, where the economy is controlled by its players.

Ownership of in-game assets and unique digital items is verified via NFTs. The tokens act as a receipt proving the right to property. Hence, users can both sell their Axies to other players and store them securely in crypto wallets like Trust Wallet, Binance Chain Wallet, or Ronin Wallet. The last one was specially designed for Axie Infinity.


### How Does Axie Infinity Work?

The gameplay of Axie Infinity is focused on fighting & breeding Axies. It consists of the following steps: buying Axies, participating in battles with other players, breeding Axies, and selling them on the marketplace.

Players need to have an Axie to join the battle and select Adventure Mode (PvE) or Arena Mode (PvP). Axies can be bred, but each Axie cannot be bred more than 7 times. Lunacia is the homeland of digital creatures. It is divided into tokenized parts where players can search for resources and upgrade their plots. On the marketplace, players can trade their Axies and land plots. 

A key feature of Axie Infinity is community engagement, where each member contributes, participates in governance, and generates content. The developers have also introduced a number of mechanics that distinguish Axie Infinity from its analogs. For instance, built-in population control. Furthermore, a wide range of Axies due to various combinations of attributes builds additional demand among gamers and collectors of rare NFTs.

To solve the scalability problem, Axie Infinity created its sidechain on Ethereum called Ronin Network. It ensures instant transactions not involving the Ethereum blockchain. Users can safely store AXS and collectible NFTs in Ethereum and Ronin wallets, and send tokens from Ethereum wallet to Ronin wallet via Ronin Bridge.

#### **How Many Axie Infinity (AXS) Coins Are There in Circulation?**

he native ecosystem token, Axie Infinity Shard (AXS), was launched in November 2020. AXS is the central mechanism for running the Axie Infinity game. Players can buy, trade and earn tokens simply by playing it. In addition, the best players of the season receive rewards in AXS. Moreover, AXS serves as a governance token that allows holders to vote on gameplay changes and influence the evolution of the platform.

Axie Infinity (AXS) tokens have a total supply of 270 million tokens. Out of this, around 53.5 million tokens were in circulation as of mid-November 2020.

In total, 11% of the total supply was allocated to participants in the [Binance Launchpad](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/1c097191f01345b090018ffcd30e445c) [IEO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-exchange-offering) sale (each Axie Infinity token price was $0.10) and 4% was sold in a private sale. In addition to this, 29% is allocated for staking rewards, 20% to the [play-to-earn](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/play-to-earn-play2earn) pool, 21% to the team, 7% to advisors and 8% to the ecosystem fund.

Based on the current release schedule, as indicated by [Binance Research](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/axie-infinity), 100% of AXS tokens will be circulating by early 2026.


### **How Is the Axie Infinity Network Secured?**

The Axie Infinity (AXS) token is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token launched on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain. As a result, it is secured by Ethereum’s [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POW) consensus mechanism.

In early 2021, Axie Infinity plans to migrate its [NFT tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mint-an-nft), including Axies, Land and other in-game item tokens from the Loom Network to a custom-built [sidechain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/side-chain) on Ethereum known as Ronin.

Ronin is an application-specific sidechain built just for Axie Infinity. It is being developed by Sky Mavis — the development firm behind the Axie Infinity game, and is designed to support almost instant transaction confirmations, reduced gas fees and be capable of helping Axie Infinity scale.


### **Where Can You Buy Axie Infinity (AXS)?**

As of October 2021, Axie Infinity (AXS) is available to trade on numerous exchange platforms, including top exchanges like: [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/), [Bithumb](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bithumb/), [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/), [Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/) and [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/).

VeChain,VET,vechain,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3077.png,coin,"To find out even more about this project, check out our deep dive of [VeChain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-vechain-vet).

## What Is VeChain (VET)?

VeChain (VET) is a versatile enterprise-grade L1 smart contract platform. 

VeChain began in 2015 as a private consoritium chain, working with a host of enterprises to explore applications of blockchain. VeChain would begin their transition to public blockchain in 2017 with the ERC-20 token VEN, before launching a mainnet of their own in 2018 using the ticker VET. 

VeChain aims to use distributed governance and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to create an ecosystem which solves major data hurdles for multiple global industries from medical to energy, food & beverage to sustainability and SDG goals. By leveraging the power of trustless data, VeChain is building the digital backbone that will underpin the fourth industrial revolution, which demands real-time and trustless data sharing between many participants. 

The platform uses two tokens, VET and [VTHO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/vethor-token/), to manage and create value based on its VeChainThor public blockchain. VET generates VTHO and acts as the store of value and value transfer medium. VTHO is used to pay for GAS costs, separating the need to expend VET when writing data. This has the additional benefit of ensuring costs of using the network can be kept stable by tweaking certain variables such as the amount of VTHO required to service a transaction, or by increasing the VTHO geneation rate. Such actions first require all-stakeholder community votes. 

VeChain has been able to demonstrate massively boosted efficiency, traceability and transparency across data trails, supply chains and within novel kinds of ecosystems, such as those in San Marino targeting UN SDGs, among others. 

### Who Are the Founders of VeChain (VET)?

VeChain is the product of creator and co-founder Sunny Lu, an IT executive who was formerly CIO of Louis Vuitton China. 

Lu has since become a well-known name within the cryptocurrency industry. He has drawn attention to the ability of blockchain technology to solve transparency in particular, arguing that it can create “trust-free” enterprise/business structures that do not suffer from information corruption thanks to close working collaborations with key auditing/certification consultants such as PriceWaterhouseCoopers and DNV who verify data quality and certify industrial processes. 

Fellow co-founder Jay Zhang, who directs VeChain's global corporate structure, governance, and financial management, previously worked for both Deloitte and PriceWaterhouseCoopers in the finance and risk management sphere. 

Having originally begun life in 2015, VeChain is one of the oldest dedicated smart contract platforms on the market, with reflected prestige among enterprise clients.

#### What Makes VeChain (VET) Unique?

VeChain exists to disrupt traditional business models, and is best known for its work in supply chain, an industry that has changed little over the decades. Its work in providing a decentralised trust layer for multi-party ecosystems has already seen major sucesses with high profile clientele and government bodies. 

Using transparent technology with no single point of weakness or control allows for greater security, efficiency and ease of tracking for all kinds of data, while reducing costs through trustless automation via smart contracts. Carbon, supply chain, international logistics, incentivised ecosystems, automobile passports and more all greatly benefit from the digitisation of trust and colaboration it enables. 

VeChain’s platform accordingly has very wide appeal to many different clients of clients and industries. 

VeChain’s official literature notes that its unique proposition lies in its dual-token setup alongside transformative protocols such as 'fee delegation' and it's one-stop 'ToolChain' platform that means crypto-wary companies can pay in fiat for VeChain's Blockchain-as-a-service, while smart contracts handle gas payment costs, ensuring frictionless use of the network, even in strict jurisdictions.

### VeChain Ecosystem

The VeChain ecosystem has its own optimized blockchain called Thor. VeChainThor is a business platform with support for [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) and data auditing. It is built on an altered version of the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) codebase where each transaction can perform multiple tasks. Cryptocurrency is not required to complete transactions. In addition, it’s a public blockchain that allows business users to implement the technology on a global scale. VeChainThor is a sustainable and scalable business blockchain ecosystem that ensures companies with a framework to make their [dApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) according to requirements. Its main tool is VeChain ToolChain which is for software development.

VeChain’s blockchain was designed to simplify supply chain management processes by making inventory tracking more transparent. The platform itself is based on distributed ledger technology to streamline operations and process a flow of information for complex supply chains.

To track transactions and regulate workflows, VeChainThor chooses a proof-of-authority ([PoA](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-authority-poa)) consensus mechanism that relies on masternodes and promotes openness, transparency and accountability. Some of the advantages are fast processing of vast amounts of transactions. The disadvantage is that a central authority is a key element of this approach, performing verification and authorization of users who take part in transaction processing.

According to the VeChain team, their goal is to improve digital collaboration by offering tools for stable and efficient data transfer between enterprises, supply-chain management, mitigation of problems, and facilitating the entire process. VeChain uses distributed ledger technology to streamline operations and handle information flows.

The ecosystem is fueled by two native cryptocurrencies, VET and VTHO. VET is a payment in VeChain's system. The token is tradeable and gives its holders a right to vote for changes in the protocol. VET is involved in the creation of VTHO. The main role of VTHO is to finance transactions on the network. The two-token design is intended to isolate the price volatility of VET from the cost of computations on the network, allowing VeChain to charge consistent and stable fees. Consequently, one token finances projects, and the other supports the blockchain.


### How Does VeChain Work?

VeChain IDs are a crucial component of the VeChain blockchain. A unique identifier is assigned to a product. Sensors are used to track each step of a supply-chain. As a result, a safe environment is formed for all parties, and movement data is documented and verified.

The general idea of ​​VeChain is to grant a way to determine authenticity and quality of real products, as well as to prevent fraud. The platform seeks to provide stakeholders with comprehensive information about products and business processes, thereby increasing market transparency and making international trade more fair and efficient. The list of VeChain clients already includes large corporations like BMW, LVMH, and Walmart.

VeChain software allows enterprise developers to create and run dApps. Therefore, due to VeChain’s blockchain, companies can apply dApps and offer a higher level of services and goods. The project also uses proprietary solutions and developments, including ToolChain, My StoryTool, the VeChainThor blockchain, and Internet of Things ([IoT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/internet-of-things)) technology to facilitate processes.

##### How Many VeChain (VET) Coins Are There In Circulation?

VeChain has two in-house tokens: VeChain (VET) and VeThor (VTHO). Described as a unique offering for such a platform, the dual-token system is designed to avoid fee fluctuations and network congestion.

VET is the token used for transactions and other activities, while VTHO provides fee payments and thus functions as a “gas token,” similar to how [gas](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) functions for Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) transactions.

VET holders automatically generate a small amount of passive income in VTHO, while 70% of the VTHO used in a VET payment is destroyed. 

VTHO is generated based on VET holdings, while VET itself has a maximum fixed supply of 86,712,634,466 tokens. 

At the time of writing (07/12/2021) - there are 66,760,741,299 tokens in circulation according to [VeChainStats](https://vechainstats.com/)

#### How Is the VeChain (VET) Network Secured?

VeChain (VET) is a Proof of Authority (PoA) token, requiring relatively low computing power to achieve network security versus a protocol such as Bitcoin. A recent [CTI report](https://www.vechain.org/vechainthor-is-one-of-the-most-eco-friendly-public-blockchains-worldwide-cti-verified/) showed that VeChain's annual carbon footprint is incredibly small at just 2.4% of the emissions of mining a single Bitcoin, thus making PoA an incredibly efficient consensus mechanism for securing the network. 

[Proof-of-authority](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-authority-poa), is a process wherein authority masternode operators are selected by an independent Steering Committee, thus giving them 'authority' to run a masternode. This model is particularly attractive for enterprises who want assurances about the integrity and quality of validators running the network, and assurances bad actors can be ejected if needed. 

#### Where Can You Buy VeChain (VET)?

VET is a freely-tradable token available on major exchanges, while markets also exist for VTHO.

VET had major markets on Binance and Huobi Global among other platforms, with pairs for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies.

Energy Web Token,EWT,energy-web-token,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5268.png,coin,"## What Is Energy Web Token (EWT)?

Energy Web Token (EWT) is the operational token behind the Energy Web Chain, a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based virtual machine designed to support and further application development for the energy sector. 

Energy Web Chain was launched in June 2019. The Energy Web Foundation is the non-profit enterprise behind the project. EWT aims to bring diversity to the energy sector by allowing developers to create decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-access-dapps-on-your-mobile-phone)). The virtual machine has the potential to benefit actors from all areas of energetics, including grid operators, software developers, and vendors.


### Who Are the Founders of Energy Web Token?

Energy Web Token is a joint project between Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and Grid Singularity (GSy). 

Rocky Mountain Institute ([RMI](https://rmi.org/)) is a leading name in research and development in the energy sector. As a prominent think tank, RMI has participated in many revolutionary projects in the energy sector. By creating the Energy Web Chain, RMI wanted to employ blockchain technology’s decentralized power to allow actors from the energy sector to develop new decentralized solutions. 

Grid Singularity ([GSy](https://gridsingularity.com/)) brought blockchain expertise to the project. As a blockchain developer, GSy was the powerhouse behind the creation of the Energy Web Chain. With renowned experts, core [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain developers, experienced energy executives, and energy regulators, GSy was an integral part for EWT to launch. 


#### What Makes Energy Web Token Unique?

When creating the Energy Web Chain, founders RMI and GSy were looking to launch a versatile blockchain solution for a wide range of applications in the energy sector. One of the main selling points of EWT is that it offers enterprises the opportunity to create completely customized decentralized apps. While blockchains like Ethereum also provide this diversity, Energy Web Chain was purposefully designed for the energy sector. 

Considering the fact that the Energy Web Chain is created with enterprise use in mind, it supports state-of-the-art scalability and data privacy. The foundation also recently released a stacked tech solution called Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS). It allows users to control and manage their electrical systems online. 

The Energy Web Token is currently placed at one hundred and second place according to the CoinMarketCap token [ranking](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/energy-web-token/) as of February 2021.

#### How Many Energy Web Token (EWT) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The Energy Web Foundation plans to release a maximum supply of 100,000,000 EWT tokens over ten years after the initial release date. Currently, there are 48,638,535 EWT tokens available on the market for trading. 

Out of the total supply, 14,093,276 tokens were distributed to the Energy Web Team as an endowment. Another 10,000,000 ETW tokens were given to two founding organizations; however, there is a waiting period until June 2021, when these tokens will become tradable. A further 4,061,709 tokens were dedicated to a community fund, which should continue increasing over ten years. 


### How Is the Energy Web Token Network Secured?

The Energy Web virtual machine operates under a proof-of-authority ([PoA](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-authority-poa)) consensus. This means that the blockchain relies on trusted validators for the creation of new blocks. The PoA consensus is an alternative validation method, and it allows faster processing times than the proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) consensus. 

### Where Can You Buy Energy Web Token (EWT)?

As the Energy Web Token is rising in popularity, it is becoming increasingly available across a wide range of exchanges. The top-rated exchange for EWT trading is [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/), with an EWT/USD trading volume of $383,098.

Next up is [Liquid](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/liquid/) with an EWT/BTC trading volume of $173,637. Last but not least, EWT is becoming more popular on [Hotbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotbit/), with an EWT/BTC trading volume of $65,375. It is important to note that investing in EWT carries a risk, just like any other type of investment.

Synthetix,SNX,synthetix,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2586.png,token,"## What Is Synthetix (SNX)?

Synthetix is building a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol that any protocol can tap into for various purposes. Its deep liquidity and low fees serve as a backend for many exciting protocols on both [Optimism](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/optimism-ethereum/) and [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). Many user-facing protocols in the Synthetix ecosystem, such as [Kwenta](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kwenta/) (Spot and Futures), [Lyra](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lyra-finance/) (Options), Polynomial (Automated Options), and [1inch](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/1inch/) & [Curve](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/) (Atomic Swaps), tap into Synthetix liquidity to power their protocols. Synthetix is built on Optimism and Ethereum mainnet. The Synthetix Network is collateralized by SNX, ETH, and [LUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/liquity-usd/), enabling the issuance of synthetic assets (Synths). Synths track and provide returns on the underlying asset without requiring one to directly hold the asset. This pooled collateral enables an array of on-chain, composable financial instruments backed by liquidity from Synthetix. Some of the most exciting upcoming releases from SNX are Perps V2, which hopes to enable low-fee on-chain futures trading through the usage of off-chain oracles, and Synthetix V3, which aims to rebuild the protocol to achieve its earliest goal, being a fully permissionless derivatives protocol. Learn more about Synthetix on their blog or by joining the SNX Discord.

The platform aims to broaden the cryptocurrency space by introducing non-blockchain assets, providing access to a more robust financial market. 


### Who Are the Founders of Synthetix? 

The network was launched in September 2017 by Kain Warwick under the name Havven (HAV). About a year later the company rebranded to Synthetix.

Kain Warwick is the founder of Synthetix and a non-executive director at the blueshyft retail network. Prior to founding Synthetix, Warwick has worked on several other cryptocurrency projects. He also founded Pouncer, a live auction site exclusive to Australia.

Peter McKean, the project’s CEO, has over two decades of experience in software development. He previously worked as a programmer at ICL Fujitsu.

Jordan Momtazi, the COO of Synthetix, is a business strategist, market analyst and sales leader with several years of experience in blockchain, cryptocurrency, digital payments and e-commerce systems.

Justin J. Moses, the CTO, was the former director of engineering at MongoDB and deputy practice head of engineering at Lab49. He also co-founded Pouncer.


#### What Makes Synthetix Unique? 

Synthetix is a decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-decentralized-exchanges-dex)) and a platform for synthetic assets. The protocol is designed in a way that exposes users to the underlying assets via synths, without having to hold the underlying asset.

The platform allows users to autonomously trade and exchange synths. It also has a staking pool where holders can stake their SNX tokens and are rewarded with a share of the transaction fees on the Synthetix Exchange.

The platform tracks the underlying assets using smart contract price delivery protocols called oracles. Synthetix allows users to trade synths seamlessly, without liquidity/slippage issues. It also eliminates the need for [third-party](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-dao) facilitators.

SNX tokens are used as collateral for the synthetic assets that are minted. This means that whenever synths are issued, SNX tokens are locked up in a smart contract. 

Since launch, the protocol has transitioned to the Optimistic Ethereum mainnet to help reduce the gas fees on the network and lower oracle latency.


#### How Many Synthetix (SNX) Coins Are There in Circulation? 

The maximum supply of SNX is 212,424,133 coins, of which 114,841,533 SNX is in circulation as of February 2021.

At the seed round and token sale stages, Synthetix sold more than 60 million tokens and was able to raise $30 million. Of the total 100,000,000 coins issued during the ICO, 20% was allocated to the team and advisors, 3% to bounties and marketing incentives, 5% to partnership incentives and 12% to the foundation.


### How Is the Synthetix Network Secured? 

The SNX token is compatible with Ethereum’s [ERC20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) standard. The Synthetix network is secured through proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) consensus. Synthetix holders [stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-staking) their SNX and earn returns from the network fees.

Another way for SNX stakers to earn rewards is via the protocol’s inflationary monetary policy, known as staking rewards. 


### Where Can You Buy Synthetix (SNX)? 

SNX tokens can be purchased at top exchanges, such as:



*   [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)
*   [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/)
*   [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/)
*   [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/)

GRELF,GRELF,grelf,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/24191.png,token,"## What is GRELF?

GRELF is a meme coin currently available on the Hedera and Avalanche networks. GRELF is based around a weird and conventionally unappealing character named, ""Gerbert the Grelf"" who lives under a stump in an enchanted forest. Gerbert the Grelf was originally created on Hedera as a spokesman for the CREETS NFT project. He was then expanded to be the center focus of the GRELF meme coin because the founder, WarlockNKey, thought having a bald, ugly, weirdo as a mascot would be funny. The GRELF project is not about utility; it is about humor, entertainment, and showcasing the wonderful in the weird.

## Who is the Founder of GRELF?

The founder of GRELF is WarlockNKey. He is doxxed and prioritizes transparency in the operation of his various projects and initiatives. WarlockNKey started his career in Web3 on Hedera in November of 2021 with the founding of the CREETS NFT project. He is known for his humor, improvisational nature, and community involvement.

## Where Can I Buy GRELF?

GRELF is currently available for purchase via the [SaucerSwap](https://www.saucerswap.finance/swap/HBAR/0.0.1159074) and [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/avalanche/trade?inputCurrency=AVAX&outputCurrency=0x945ca41d03ec19b6a6ebf2ef0f4d0a50b23e4f2c/) exchanges.

### What is the Supply of GRELF?

GRELF launched on Hedera mainnet on August 30th, 2022 with a total fixed supply of 6.6 million GRELF tokens (6,666,666.) No keys were created for the project so the amount of supply cannot be increased, decreased, or altered. 

### Porting GRELF to Other Networks 

GRELF is integrated into [hashport]( https://app.hashport.network/?from=0.0.1159074-295) and is able to be ported to many different networks, most notably Avalanche. However, this does not change GRELF’s fixed total supply of 6,666,666. When GRELF tokens are ported to another network from Hedera, the Hedera-based tokens are locked up while representative tokens are minted. Then, when GRELF tokens are ported back to Hedera from another network the representative tokens are locked up and the Hedera native GRELF tokens are unlocked. This ensures that the supply of GRELF does not increase and is, instead, shared across multiple networks and ecosystems.

Ethereum,ETH,ethereum,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1027.png,coin,"## What Is Ethereum (ETH)?

Ethereum is a decentralized open-source [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for numerous other [cryptocurrencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies), as well as for the execution of decentralized [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract).

[Ethereum was first described](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/an-intro-to-ethereum-eth) in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014. The project team managed to raise $18.3 million in Bitcoin, and Ethereum’s price in the [Initial Coin Offering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) (ICO) was $0.311, with over 60 million Ether sold. Taking Ethereum’s price now, this puts the [return on investment](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/roi) (ROI) at an annualized rate of over 270%, essentially almost quadrupling your investment every year since the summer of 2014.

The Ethereum Foundation officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015, under the prototype codenamed “Frontier.” Since then, there has been several network updates — “Constantinople” on Feb. 28, 2019, “Istanbul” on Dec. 8, 2019, “Muir Glacier” on Jan. 2, 2020, “Berlin” on April 14, 2021, and most recently on Aug. 5, 2021, the “London” [hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hard-fork-blockchain).

Ethereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized applications, allowing users from all over the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud.

### Who Are the Founders of Ethereum?

Ethereum has a total of eight [co-founders](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/who-founded-ethereum) — an unusually large number for a crypto project. They first met on June 7, 2014, in Zug, Switzerland.


* Russian-Canadian [Vitalik Buterin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/people/vitalik-buterin) is perhaps the best known of the bunch. He authored the original white paper that first described Ethereum in 2013 and still works on improving the platform to this day. Prior to ETH, Buterin co-founded and wrote for the Bitcoin Magazine news website.
* British programmer [Gavin Wood](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/people/gavin-wood) is arguably the second most important co-founder of ETH, as he coded the first technical implementation of Ethereum in the C++ programming language, proposed Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity and was the first chief technology officer of the Ethereum Foundation. Before Ethereum, Wood was a research scientist at Microsoft. Afterward, he moved on to establish the Web3 Foundation.

Among the other co-founders of Ethereum are: - Anthony Di Iorio, who underwrote the project during its early stage of development. - [Charles Hoskinson](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/people/charles-hoskinson), who played the principal role in establishing the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation and its legal framework. - Mihai Alisie, who provided assistance in establishing the Ethereum Foundation. - [Joseph Lubin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/people/joseph-lubin), a Canadian entrepreneur, who, like Di Iorio, has helped fund Ethereum during its early days, and later founded an incubator for startups based on ETH called ConsenSys. - Amir Chetrit, who helped co-found Ethereum but stepped away from it early into the development.


#### What Makes Ethereum Unique?

Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability.

Ethereum’s principal innovation was designing a platform that allowed it to execute smart contracts using the blockchain, which further reinforces the already existing benefits of smart contract technology. Ethereum’s blockchain was designed, according to co-founder Gavin Wood, as a sort of “one computer for the entire planet,” theoretically able to make any program more robust, censorship-resistant and less prone to fraud by running it on a globally distributed network of public nodes.

In addition to smart contracts, Ethereum’s blockchain is able to host other cryptocurrencies, called “tokens,” through the use of its [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/the-beginners-guide-to-erc-20-tokens-and-addresses) compatibility standard. In fact, this has been the most common use for the ETH platform so far: to date, more than 280,000 ERC-20-compliant tokens have been launched. Over 40 of these make the top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, for example, [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), [LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/) and [BNB](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/). Since the emergence of [Play2Earn](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/play2earn-play-to-earn) games, there has been a substantial increase in interest in the [ETH to PHP price](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/eth/php/).

## What is Ethereum Name Service?

[Ethereum Name Service](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-ens), aka ENS, is a distributed and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. It is essentially the Web3 version of DNS, short for domain name service.

In its original state, a cryptocurrency address consists of a long string of numbers and letters designed to be read by computers. It may look like this — “0xDC25EF3F5B8A186998338A2ADA83795FBA2D695E” — making it confusing at times to read, and in some cases even leading to loss of funds.

ENS provides a solution to this problem of long and confusing crypto addresses by assigning human-readable names to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, metadata, other cryptocurrency addresses and content hashes. With ENS, the long address above could become something as simple as “Alice.eth,” and you can receive any type of cryptocurrency or NFT via your ENS domain.

ENS is based on two Ethereum smart contracts. The first is the ENS registry, which records three critical pieces of information: the owner of the domain, the resolver for the domain and the caching time for all records under the domain. The second smart contract is the Resolver, which translates the domain name to a machine-readable address and vice-versa.

It is worth adding that in addition to integrating with .eth names, ENS also supports the most popular DNS names, including .com, .org, .io, .app and several others.


### What is an Ethereum Killer?

Since its inception, Ethereum has maintained its spot as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. But like every other blockchain network that exists, Ethereum is not perfect. Notable, the legacy blockchain is plagued with high gas fees and low throughput of between 15 to 30 transactions per second.

Although plans are already on the way to solve these shortcomings through several upgrades, many competitors have capitalized on this delay to offer crypto users cheaper and faster transactions.

The term “Ethereum Killer” emerged around 2016/2017 as substitute blockchains such as Cardano began to enter the crypto scene. In 2018, EOS made its debut as the next “Ethereum killer,” raising $4.1 billion from investors, the highest amount an ICO had ever generated. Since then, others like Tezos, Solana, Fantom, Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain have surfaced as possible Ethereum killers.

Each of these blockchains employs a different consensus model to tackle Ethereum’s PoW-induced limitations. For instance, Solana uses proof-of-history (PoH) while Binance Smart Chain utilizes both proof-of-authority (PoA) and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS).

However, none of these alternative blockchains have been able to unseat Ethereum as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ethereum is also currently the largest blockchain for NFT trading activities.

## Ethereum London Hard Fork

The Ethereum network has been plagued with high transaction fees, often spiking at seasons of high demand. In May 2021, the average transaction fee of the network peaked at [$71.72](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee).

In addition to the high cost of transactions, the leading altcoin also suffers from scalability issues.

As already mentioned, there are plans to transition to a proof-of-stake algorithm in order to boost the platform’s scalability and add a number of new features. The development team has already begun the transition process to ETH 2.0, implementing some upgrades along the way, including the London hard fork.

The London upgrade went live in August 2021. It included five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), namely EIP-3529, EIP-3198, EIP-3541, and most notably EIP-1559 and EIP-3554.

EIP-1559 is arguably the most popular upgrade out of all the EIPs.


### What Is EIP-1559?

The EIP-1559 upgrade introduces a mechanism that changes the way gas fees are estimated on the Ethereum blockchain. Before the upgrade, users had to participate in an open auction for their transactions to be picked up by a miner. This process is known as a “first-price auction,” and as expected, the highest bidder wins. 

With EIP-1559, this process is handled by an automated bidding system, and there is a set “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. This fee varies based on how congested the network is. Furthermore, users who wish to speed up their transactions can pay a “priority fee” to a miner for faster inclusion.

EIP-1559 also introduces a fee-burning mechanism. A part of every transaction fee (the base fee) is burned and removed out of circulation. This is intended to lower the circulating supply of Ether and potentially increase the value of the token over time.

Interestingly, less than two months after the London upgrade was implemented, the network had burned over $1 billion worth of Ether.

### Ethereum 2.0

In 2022, Ethereum plans to switch to [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) with its [Ethereum 2.0 update](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0). This switch has been in the Ethereum roadmap since the network's inception and would see a new [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism), as well as introduce [sharding](https://coinmarketcap.com/glossary/#sharding) as a scaling solution. The current Ethereum chain will become the Beacon Chain and serve as a settlement layer for smart contract interactions on other chains. 

In late 2021, Ethereum's [Arrow Glacier update](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-s-arrow-glacier-upgrade-to-delay-ice-age-s-difficulty-bomb-till-summer-2022) was delayed to June 2022. Until then, Vitalik Buterin expects the road to the network's [endgame](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html) to be shaped by [optimistic rollups](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/optimistic-rollup) and [Zk-rollups](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zero-knowledge-rollups). 

In January 2022, the Ethereum Foundation [announced](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-2-0-is-dead-well-kinda) the decision to remove the “Ethereum 2.0” terminology to “save all future users from navigating this confusing mental model.” It went on to explain that the previously-referred-to terms of “Ethereum 1.0” would be branded the “execution layer,” while “Ethereum 2.0” will be called the “consensus layer”. This is ultimately to provide a more accurate version of the Ethereum roadmap.


In an update on the progress of the Merge, on April 13, 2022, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko [tweeted an update](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/the-merge-coming-soon-says-ethereum-developer) on the progress of the Merge, stating that they are “definitely in the final chapter of PoW on Ethereum.” He also mentioned that users can expect it to occur a few months after June, although no exact date was provided. This came on the back of the [first mainnet shadow fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-launches-first-mainnet-shadow-fork) — to test the transition to PoS on Ethereum — that was successfully implemented on April 11, 2022. 

## The Ethereum Merge

In 2022, Ethereum [renamed](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-renaming-ethereum-1-0-and-2-0-are-no-more) its transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake from [Ethereum 2.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0) to [The Merge](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/the-eth-merge-trade). The Merge [went live](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/date-of-ethereum-merge-date-revealed) on Sept. 15, 2022, after the merge of the Goerli testnet successfully [completed](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ether-surges-after-successful-final-dress-rehearsal-before-long-awaited-merge) on Aug. 11, 2022.

Read: [All you ever wanted to learn about the Ethereum Merge](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/all-you-ever-wanted-to-learn-about-the-ethereum-merge).

The Merge implements several critical changes to Ethereum. First, it merges the existing PoW Ethereum mainnet with the Beacon Chain, a PoS chain. Together, the two chains will form the new proof-of-stake Ethereum, which will consist of a consensus layer and an execution layer. The consensus layer will synchronize the chain state across the network, while the execution layer handles transactions and block production.

Second, the Merge significantly reduces ETH issuance. This has been dubbed the ""triple halving"" in a nod to the [Bitcoin halving](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-halvings-what-they-are-why-they-happen-and-why-you-should-care), since the Merge reduces ETH issuance by 90%. With more than 14M ETH already staked, ETH could very well become deflationary after the transition. Furthermore, stakers are expected to earn between 8% and 12% [APR](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/annual-percentage-rate-apr) at current projections. Staked ETH will not be withdrawable immediately after the Merge — it will only be enabled after the Shanghai upgrade, estimated to be 6 to 12 months later.

Learn more about the [common misconceptions of Ethereum post-Merge](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ethereum-merge-to-avoid-misconceptions).

The Merge will not increase transaction [throughput](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/throughput) or reduce [gas fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-gas-fees), as the block production rate stays roughly the same at 12 seconds (currently 13 seconds). It will also not enable [on-chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/on-chain) [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance), with protocol changes still discussed and decided [off-chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/off-chain) through stakeholders. 

Importantly, the transition to PoS is expected to [reduce Ethereum's annual energy consumption](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-will-ethereum-2-reduce-energy-consumption) from 112 TWh/yr to only 0.01 TWh/yr — a 99.9% drop. This reduction prompted investors to expect an influx of institutional money in a ""greener"" Ethereum. On the flip side, Ethereum [miners](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/miners), in an industry estimated to be worth $19 billion, seek to champion [ETHPoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-pow/), a potential [hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hard-fork-blockchain) of Ethereum on proof-of-work. We explain the main differences in our [ETH PoS vs ETH PoW article](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-proof-of-work-pow-vs-ethereum-proof-of-stake-pos).

## Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade

The biggest Ethereum upgrade since [The Merge](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/all-you-ever-wanted-to-learn-about-the-ethereum-merge), the Shanghai Upgrade will allow ETH stakers to unstake their ETH and withdraw ETH rewards from the [Beacon Chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/beacon-chain). During The Merge, the Ethereum proof-of-work chain merged with the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain. Instead of mining, validators stake 32 ETH to secure the network. However, stakers are unable to unstake and withdraw until the Shanghai Upgrade.

The Shanghai/Capella (“Shapella”) Upgrade is a [hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hard-fork-blockchain) that will implement five [EIPs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-improvement-proposal-eip) — the most anticipated being EIP-4895, which will enable withdrawals. Shanghai is the hard fork’s name on the execution layer, while Capella is the name on the consensus layer.

On Feb. 7, 2023, withdrawals on the Zhejiang [testnet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/testnet) were enabled, and on Feb. 28, the Sepolia testnet successfully executed the hard fork upgrade. On March 15, 2023, the hard fork was executed on the [Goerli](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-set-up-an-eth-2-0-validator-on-goerli-testnet) testnet, the last test run before the mainnet upgrade, expected to happen sometime in March 2023. Over 17.5 million ETH will become available for withdrawals.

#### How Many Ethereum (ETH) Coins Are There In Circulation?

In September 2021, there were around 117.5 million ETH coins in circulation, 72 million of which were issued in the genesis block — the first ever block on the Ethereum blockchain. Of these 72 million, 60 million were allocated to the initial contributors to the 2014 crowd sale that funded the project, and 12 million were given to the development fund.

The remaining amount has been issued in the form of block rewards to the miners on the Ethereum network. The original reward in 2015 was 5 ETH per block, which later went down to 3 ETH in late 2017 and then to 2 ETH in early 2019. The average time it takes to mine an Ethereum block is around 13-15 seconds.

In the August 2021 Ethereum network upgrade, the London hard fork contained the [Ethereum Improvement Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-improvement-proposal-eip), EIP-1559. Instead of the first-price auction mechanism where the highest bidder wins, EIP-1559 introduces a “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. Users that want to have their transaction prioritized can pay a “tip” or “priority fee” to miners. As the base fee adjusts dynamically with transaction activity, this reduces the volatility of Ethereum gas fees, although it does not reduce the price, which is notoriously high during peak congestion on the network.

One of the major differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s [economics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics) is that the latter is not deflationary, i.e. its total supply is not limited. Ethereum’s developers [justify](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/) this by not wanting to have a “fixed security budget” for the network. Being able to adjust ETH’s issuance rate via [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) allows the network to maintain the minimum issuance needed for adequate security.

With the introduction of EIP-1559 however, the base fees used in transactions are burned, removing the ETH from circulation. This means higher activity on the network would lead to more ETH burned, and the decreasing supply should lead to appreciation of Ethereum price, all things equal. This has the potential to make Ethereum deflationary, something ETH holders are excited about — a potential appreciation in Ethereum price today.


#### How Is the Ethereum Network Secured?

As of August 2020, Ethereum is secured via the Ethash proof-of-work algorithm, belonging to the Keccak family of hash functions.

There are plans, however, to transition the network to a proof-of-stake algorithm tied to the major [Ethereum 2.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0) update, which launched in late 2020.

After the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain (Phase 0) went live in the beginning of December 2020, it became possible to begin staking on the Ethereum 2.0 network. An Ethereum stake is when you deposit ETH (32 ETH is required to activate validator software) on Ethereum 2.0 by sending it to a deposit contract, thus helping to secure the network by storing data, processing transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. At the time of writing in mid-September 2021, the Ethereum price now for 32 Ether is roughly $116,029. The amount of money earned by Ethereum validators right now is a return of 6% APR, which equates to around 1.91952 ETH, or $6960 in Ethereum price today. This number will change as the network develops and the amount of stakers (validators) increase.

Ethereum staking rewards are determined by a distribution curve (the participation and average percent of stakers): some ETH 2.0 staking rewards were at 20% for early stakers, but will be lowered to end up between 7% and 4.5% annually. 

The minimum requirements for an Ethereum stake are 32 ETH. If you decide to stake in Ethereum 2.0, it means that your Ethererum stake will be locked up on the network for months, if not years, in the future until the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is completed.


#### Where Can You Buy Ethereum (ETH)?

Given the fact that Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, it is possible to [buy Ethereum](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Ethereum), or use ETH trading pairs on nearly all of the major crypto exchanges. Some of the largest markets include:

* [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/price/ethereum)

Unicorn Milk,UNIM,unicorn-milk-token,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/19387.png,token,"Crypto Unicorns is a blockchain-based game centered around awesomely unique Unicorn NFTs which players can use in a fun farming simulation and in a variety of exciting battle loops.
Farming gameplay centers on Land NFTs which players can buy and upgrade over time. Unicorns love to help around the farm so players can put them to work increasing the productive output of Land and crafting materials to upgrade buildings. Individual Land can be combined by players into neighborhoods designed for highly social real-time gameplay. In this fashion, players can customize their Farm.

Crypto Unicorns is starting with Farming gameplay followed by Jousting, Racing and Team RPG Battle. Each game type will leverage different Unicorn abilities over time. For example, a really good racing Unicorn might not be a great jouster nor “Battlecorn”. Ultimately, Crypto Unicorns envisions an ever expanding universe of game loops interconnected with the core farming loop. To achieve this, Crypto Unicorns wants to work with the community and other developers to continue adding utility and fun to the Crypto Unicorns Multiverse.

UNIM is an ERC20 Token used to breed and evolve Unicorns as well as craft high-value items and boosters. Players earn this currency by competing in various events and tournaments. When it is used, it is burned and removed from the supply. Crypto Unicorns expects UNIM to function as the lifeblood of the economy and Crypto Unicorns will closely monitor its distribution to ensure long-term economic health.","{""website"":[""https://www.cryptounicorns.fun/""],""technical_doc"":[""https://whitepaper.cryptounicorns.fun/crypto-unicorns-whitepaper-v2/""],""explorer"":[""https://polygonscan.com/token/0x64060ab139feaae7f06ca4e63189d86adeb51691""],""source_code"":[""https://github.com/Laguna-Games/rbw-public""],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/03nbij4l989b"",""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/unicorn-milk-token"",""https://medium.com/@lagunagames""],""chat"":[""https://discord.gg/xSAAjcEWRU"",""https://t.me/crypto_unicorns""],""announcement"":[],""reddit"":[""https://reddit.com/r/cryptounicorns""],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/crypto_unicorns""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3890.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x64060ab139feaae7f06ca4e63189d86adeb51691"",""ContractPlatform"":""Polygon"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://polygonscan.com/token/0x64060ab139feaae7f06ca4e63189d86adeb51691""}]",[],[]

The project's goal is to provide a platform where users can access various financial services, including lending, borrowing, and staking, in a secure and decentralized manner.

The Koyo Token is the native cryptocurrency of the platform, and it serves as a means of payment for accessing the different financial services on the platform. The token is ERC-20 compliant, meaning that it can be stored in any ERC-20 compatible wallet and traded on any ERC-20 compatible exchange.

One of the unique features of Koyo Token is its decentralized governance model. The project is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that is composed of Koyo Token holders. The DAO allows token holders to participate in the decision-making process of the project, such as voting on proposals for platform upgrades, changes to the tokenomics, and more.

The Koyo Token platform also provides users with the opportunity to earn rewards through staking. Staking involves holding a certain amount of Koyo Tokens in a wallet for a specified period, in exchange for earning rewards in the form of more Koyo Tokens.

Overall, Koyo Token aims to provide a secure and transparent financial ecosystem that empowers users to take control of their finances and participate in the governance of the platform.","{""website"":[""https://koyotoken.com/""],""technical_doc"":[],""explorer"":[""https://etherscan.io/token/0x198065e69a86cb8a9154b333aad8efe7a3c256f8""],""source_code"":[],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/KoyoToken"",""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/koyo""],""chat"":[""https://t.me/KoyoToken""],""announcement"":[],""reddit"":[],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/koyotoken""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1027.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x198065e69a86cb8a9154b333aad8efe7a3c256f8"",""ContractPlatform"":""Ethereum"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://etherscan.io/token/0x198065e69a86cb8a9154b333aad8efe7a3c256f8""}]",[],[]

Axelar,AXL,axelar,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/17799.png,token,"## What Is Axelar (AXL)?

Axelar claims to deliver “secure cross-chain communication for Web3.” The project provides a [decentralized](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized) network and tools to help builders of [decentralized applications](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) (dApps) with seamless [cross-chain communication](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cross-chain-communication) through its protocol suite, tools and APIs.

Axelar features three core components – a decentralized network, a software development kit of protocols and APIs, and a set of gateway [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) for [cross-chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cross-chain) connectivity.

Powered by a decentralized network of [validators](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/validator), anyone can join the network, build on it, or use it. Apps builders can interact with a simple API atop a permissionless network that routes messages and ensures network security via [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) (PoS) [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism).

AXL is the native token of the Axelar network. The protocol also supports the cross-chain transfer of several native tokens via their wrapped [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) versions, including [AVAX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/) (Avalanche), [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (Ethereum), [FTM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/) (Fantom), [GLMR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moonbeam/) (Moonbeam), and [MATIC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/) (Polygon).

Meanwhile, Axelar has raised capital from top-tier investors, including Binance, Coinbase Ventures, Dragonfly Capital, Polychain Capital and others.


## Who Are the Founders of Axelar?

The blockchain platform was launched in 2020 by Georgios Vlachos and Sergey Gorbunov, both part of the founding team at [Algorand](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/algorand/). While Georgios designed the Algorand consensus protocol, Sergey led the effort to standardize BLS signatures, a standard that is now adopted as a draft in CFRG and was followed by Ethereum 2.0 implementations and others.

## What Makes Axelar Unique?

One thing that sets Axelar apart is its secure cross-chain communication over a dynamic validator. While a handful of projects are using optimistic setups and federated multi-sig, Axelar claims to be the only network building these capabilities on Proof-of-Stake.

Furthermore, the blockchain project has built protocols, APIs, and developer tools that make it easy for application developers to build cross-chain, without the need to learn a new programming language. “Our value proposition to the developer is that they can build on the chain that best suits their use case and background, while letting their users access anything on the decentralized web, with one click,” said co-founder Georgios Vlachos.


## Axelar $60M Startup Ecosystem Program

In December 2022, Axelar launched a $60 million startup funding program. The initiative, which is backed by over 15 blockchain investors, seeks to accelerate the development of decentralized applications and protocols that can replace [centralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex) (CEXs).

Dubbed the Axelar Ecosystem Startup Funding Program, the initiative is designed to “nurture a pipeline of developers building Web3 products that are better than anything on the centralized web.”

To qualify for funding, a project must be involved in safeguarding digital sovereignty, security, and privacy, working on the mass adoption of blockchain tech, or solving global problems that the centralized internet cannot address.

NEAR Protocol,NEAR,near-protocol,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/6535.png,coin,"To find out even more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Near](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-near).

## What Is NEAR Protocol (NEAR)?

[NEAR Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/near-protocol/) is a [layer-one blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) that was designed as a community-run cloud computing platform and that eliminates some of the limitations that have been bogging competing blockchains, such as low transaction speeds, low throughput and poor interoperability. This provides the ideal environment for [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) and creates a developer and user-friendly platform. For instance, NEAR uses human-readable account names, unlike the cryptographic wallet addresses common to [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). NEAR also introduces unique solutions to scaling problems and has its own [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism) called “Doomslug.” 

NEAR Protocol is being built by the NEAR Collective, its community that is updating the initial code and releasing updates to the ecosystem. Its declared goal is to build a platform that is “secure enough to manage high value assets like money or identity and performant enough to make them useful for everyday people.”

[Flux](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zel/), a protocol that allows developers to create markets based on assets, commodities, real-world events, and Mintbase, an [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) minting platform are examples of projects being built on NEAR Protocol.


## Who Are the Founders of NEAR Protocol (NEAR)?

NEAR Protocol was founded by Erik Trautman, an entrepreneur with experience on Wall Street and founder of Viking Education. His co-founders were Illia Polosukhin, who has more than ten years of industry experience, including three years at Google, and Alexander Skidanov, a computer scientist that worked at Microsoft and went on to join memSQL, where he became the director of engineering. NEAR Protocol has an extensive team of experienced developers that includes several International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) gold medalists and winners. The team claims to have people with experience of building some of the only real-world sharded systems at scale, a solution the protocol is pursuing to improve blockchain scalability. 


## What Makes NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Unique?

NEAR uses its Nightshade technology to improve transaction throughput massively. Nightshade is a variation of [sharding](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sharding), in which individual sets of validators process transactions in parallel across multiple sharded chains, improving the overall capacity of the blockchain. In contrast to “regular” sharding, shards in Nightshade produce a fraction of the next block, called “chunks.” In doing so, NEAR Protocol is able to achieve up to 100,000 transactions per second and achieve near-instant transaction finality thanks to a one-second block cadence while simultaneously keeping transaction fees at virtually zero.

NEAR Protocol also improves upon the convoluted onboarding process of other blockchains by having human-readable addresses and building decentralized applications with similar registration flow to what users have already experienced. Moreover, it provides developers with modular components, helping them start projects like token contracts or NFTs more quickly.

### Near Protocol Ecosystem Fund

On Oct. 25, 2021, NEAR [announced](https://near.org/blog/near-announces-800-million-in-funding-initiatives-to-support-ecosystem-growth/) a $800 million in ecosystem funding initiatives, following in the footsteps of various [Layer-1s](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) blockchains like [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), [Fantom](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/) and [Celo](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celo/). The fund will be used to bankroll initiatives that will focus on accelerating growth in the NEAR protocol ecosystem. The fund includes $350 million in funding from Proximity Labs. Out of the total fund, $250 million will be used to help existing projects scale, and $100 million will be allocated to the Startup Grant Pools, where 20 startups will be given $5M each. NEAR will focus on funding [Decentralized Finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi) focused teams that are “actively revolutionizing and reimagining the way we interact with money.” NEAR is also actively looking for projects building on [NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token), [DAOs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) and gaming. On a separate note, NEAR recently raised $150 million in seed investment led by Three Arrows Capital, with additional participation from Mechanism Capital, Dragonfly Capital, a16z, Jump, Alameda, Zee Prime and more. This will be used to accelerate the adoption of [Web3](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/web-3-0) technologies.

## NEAR Protocol for Developers

NEAR protocol's vision of making blockchain technology accessible to all keeps driving the development efforts of NEAR Collective and the community. 

In August 2022, The NEAR team [announced](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/near-releases-javascript-sdk-bringing-web3-to-20-million-developers-b084efef0a9c) the release of a [JavaScript](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/javascript) software development kit (JS SDK). The NEAR JS SDK is expected to open the door for more than 20 million programmers who use the JavaScript programming language in [Web2](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/web-2-0) to enter the blockchain and [Web3](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-web-3-0) space. 

According to the NEAR team, this alone is ten times more than the global population of around 2.5 million programmers that use the most popular blockchain programming languages, [Rust](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/rust) and [Solidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/solidity). The NEAR JS SDK will leverage JavaScript's ease of use and simplicity in developing [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). 

“Developers can spend less time learning a new language and more time building their application in a language they already know. Millions of developers already know how to program in JavaScript; enabling this group to build novel applications on NEAR is a critical step in achieving our vision of a billion users interacting with NEAR.” Illia Polosukhin, a co-founder of NEAR, said in a statement. 

The SDK, which is developed by Pagoda, the engineering team that builds and maintains NEAR Protocol and some of the most important tools needed for [decentralized application](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) ([dApp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) development, is implemented in [TypeScript](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/typescript-programming-language) and comes out of the box with everything a developer needs to ""dive right into blockchain development."" 


## NEAR Protocol Ecosystem Expansion

With a focus on ease of use in deploying projects and user experience, the NEAR protocol has been growing rapidly. The network has recently seen the public [beta](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/beta-release) [launch](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/first-near-based-mobile-wallet-sender-launches-public-beta-154267de8a01) of its [non-custodial](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-custodial) mobile wallet app, Sender. 

The android APK of the wallet, which is already connected to over 20 leading projects in the NEAR ecosystem and has over 300k downloads of its web extension, can now be downloaded from Sender Labs' website. Sender Labs received seed funding from [Binance Labs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/binance-labs) and Metaweb Ventures last year and closed a private funding round this year.  

Since the [mainnet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mainnet) launch of the network in 2020, NEAR protocol has seen the launch of nine dApps with a TVL of around $285 million, at the time of writing. 

 


## NEAR Protocol’s Security 

Rainbow, a NEAR-Ethereum bridge, has successfully thwarted two attacks with the second hack attempt resulting in the hacker losing 2.5 ETH. 

In September 2022, NEAR protocol also [announced](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/near-top-news-3-938358826e2) that it had successfully mitigated two vulnerabilities on Aurora, its Ethereum [sidechain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/side-chain), through its bug bounty program. 

The dynamically sharded Proof-of-Stake carbon-neutral blockchain team, built for usability and scalability, remains confident that by combining the power of both [PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) and [sharding](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sharding), it can become one of the most scalable, secure and sustainable blockchain networks in the crypto space.

## How Many NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The total supply of NEAR is 1 billion tokens, according to the following token distribution:



* 17.2% - Community Grants
* 11.4% - Operation Grants
* 10% - Foundation Endowment
* 11.7% - Early Ecosystem
* 14% - Core Contributors
* 17.6% - Backers
* 6.1% - Small Backers
* 12% - Community Sale

NEAR Protocol launched its mainnet on April 22, 2020 with 1 billion NEAR tokens created at genesis. 5% of additional supply is issued each year to support the network as epoch rewards, of which 90% goes to validators (4.5% total) and 10% to the protocol treasury (0.5% total). 30% of transaction fees are paid out as rebates to contracts that interact with a transaction, while the remaining 70% are burned. The NEAR token is used for:



* Fees for processing transactions and storing data.
* Running validator nodes on the network via staking NEAR tokens.
* Used for governance votes to determine how network resources are allocated.


## How Is the NEAR Protocol Network Secured?

NEAR uses a variation of the [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) consensus mechanism called Doomslug. Doomslug is based on two rounds of consensus, where a block is considered finalized as soon as it has received the first communication round. This allows for near-instant finality by having validators take turns producing blocks rather than competing directly based on their stake.

The NEAR Foundation is a Swiss-based non-profit dedicated to protocol maintenance, ecosystem funding, and guiding the protocol's governance. The protocol has also built a bridge to Ethereum, allowing users to transfer [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens from the Ethereum blockchain to NEAR.


## Where Can You Buy NEAR Protocol (NEAR)?

NEAR is available on [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [Mandala Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mandala/) and [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/).

Dai,DAI,multi-collateral-dai,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/4943.png,token,"## What Is DAI [DAI]?

DAI is an Ethereum-based [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) (stable-price cryptocurrency) whose issuance and development is managed by the Maker Protocol and the MakerDAO decentralized autonomous organization. 

The price of DAI is soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar and is collateralized by a mix of other cryptocurrencies that are deposited into [smart-contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) vaults every time new DAI is minted.

It is important to differentiate between Multi-Collateral DAI and Single-Collateral DAI (SAI), an earlier version of the token that could only be collateralized by a single cryptocurrency; SAI also doesn’t support the DAI Savings Rate, which allows users to earn savings by holding DAI tokens.

Multi-Collateral DAI was launched in November 2019.


### Who Are the Founders of DAI?

One of the defining features of DAI is that it wasn’t created by any single person or a small group of co-founders. Instead, the development of the software that powers it and the issuance of new tokens is governed by the MakerDAO and Maker Protocol.

MakerDAO is a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) — a kind of company that runs itself in a decentralized manner via the use of smart contracts — self-enforcing agreements expressed in software code and executed on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain).

This organization is managed democratically by the holders of its Maker (MKR) governance tokens, which act similarly to a traditional company’s stock; MKR holders can vote on key decisions regarding the development of MakerDAO, Maker Protocol and DAI, with their voting power being proportionate to the amount of Maker tokens they own.

MakerDAO itself was originally founded by a Danish entrepreneur Rune Christensen in 2015. Before starting work on the Maker ecosystem, Christensen studied biochemistry and international business in Copenhagen and founded the Try China international recruiting firm.

### How to Generate Dai?

Dai is the second-largest decentralized stablecoin by [market capitalization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/market-capitalization-market-cap-mcap), having been [flipped](https://decrypt.co/88791/terra-ust-flips-dai-fourth-largest-stablecoin) recently by Terra’s native stablecoin — [UST](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terrausd/). Both are backed by cryptocurrencies and pegged to the Dollar, while the top stablecoins like [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) and [BUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/) are backed by traditional assets such as cash, corporate bonds, U.S. treasuries and commercial papers (which has come under [increased scrutiny](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/mystery-over-tether-s-billions-deepens) in the case of USDT). So what exactly is Dai backed by? The Dai stablecoin is a collateral-based cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar. Users generate Dai by depositing crypto-assets into Maker Vaults on the Maker Protocol. Users can access Maker Protocol and create Vaults through Oasis Borrow or other interfaces built by the community. On [Oasis Borrow](https://oasis.app/borrow), users can lock in collateral such as [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), [WBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/), [LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/), [UNI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/), [YFI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/), [MANA](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/), [MATIC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/) and more. Users can then borrow against their collateral in Dai, as long as it is within the collateral ratio, which ranges from 101% to 175%, depending on the risk level of the asset locked.

#### What Makes DAI Unique?

DAI’s main advantage lies in its soft peg to the price of the U.S. dollar.

The crypto market is notorious for its volatility with even the largest, highly-[liquid](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) coins such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) sometimes experiencing price changes (both up and down) of 10% or more within a single day. Under these circumstances, traders and investors are naturally predisposed to add safe-haven assets to their portfolios, whose stable price might help offset significant market fluctuations.

One such kind of asset are stablecoins, of which DAI is one example. These are cryptocurrencies whose price is pegged to assets with a relatively stable value — most commonly traditional fiat currencies, such as USD or EUR.

Another key advantage of DAI is the fact that it is managed not by a private company, but rather by a decentralized autonomous organization via a software protocol. As a result, all instances of issuance and burning of tokens are managed and publicly recorded by Ethereum-powered self-enforcing smart-contracts, making the entire system more transparent and less prone to corruption. 

In addition, the process of developing DAI software is governed in a more democratic way — via direct voting by the regular participants of the token’s ecosystem.

## The Crash of Algorithmic Stablecoins and its Impact on DAI

Although DAI was the first of its kind, it began to lose market share to emerging alternatives in the last bull market, especially Terra's UST – now called [TerraClassicUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terrausd/). UST, unlike DAI, is an undercollateralized and [algorithmic stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/algorithmic-stablecoin) tethered to the U.S. dollar. However, without sufficient [collateral](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/collateral) and due to the algorithmic design, the [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin) and underlying Terra, now [TerraClassic](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/), token were unable to shield themselves from an aggressive sell-off. In the end, the entire Terra ecosystem caved in, wiping over $18 billion off UST's $18.6 billion market cap after the crash. Read our full breakdown of the [Terra crash](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/are-algorithmic-stablecoins-dead-already-a-full-breakdown-of-the-terra-crash).

Unsurprisingly, the slump of UST had a massive impact on other stablecoins, including DAI. Although DAI managed to maintain its peg to the USD, there was a steep drop in its [market capitalization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/market-capitalization-market-cap-mcap) from $8 billion to $6.33 billion. However, once the token found its floor, it began to experience a surge in demand for DAI, which later caused a DAI token to sell for a premium (slightly above $1).

While the crash of UST threatened the validity of algorithmic stablecoins, the performance of DAI during this stretch may suggest that not all hope is lost for decentralized stablecoins. It also highlights the importance of the over-collateralization of stablecoins.

#### How Many DAI [DAI] Coins Are There in Circulation?

New DAI tokens are not produced via [mining](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin) like Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)) and Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)), nor are they minted by a private company according to its own issuance police like Tether ([USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)). Instead, new DAI can be minted by any user via the use of Maker Protocol.

Maker Protocol, which runs on the Ethereum blockchain, is the software that governs DAI issuance. In order to maintain the soft price peg to the U.S. dollar, Maker Protocol ensures that every DAI token is collateralized by an appropriate amount of other cryptocurrencies. As part of this process, the Protocol allows any user to deposit their crypto into a so-called vault — a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain — as collateral and mint a corresponding amount of new DAI tokens.

There is no upper limit on the total supply of DAI — the supply is dynamic and depends on how much collateral is stored in the vaults at any given moment. As of November 2020, there are around 940 million DAI in circulation.


### How Is the DAI Network Secured?

DAI is an Ethereum-based, [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20)-compatible token. As such, it is secured by Ethereum’s Ethash algorithm.

Avalanche,AVAX,avalanche,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5805.png,coin,"## What Is Avalanche (AVAX)?

[Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/) is a [layer one blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) that functions as a platform for decentralized applications and custom blockchain networks. It is one of Ethereum’s rivals, aiming to unseat [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) as the most popular blockchain for [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/smart-contract). It aims to do so by having a higher transaction output of up to 6,500 transactions per second while not compromising scalability. 

This is made possible by Avalanche’s unique architecture. The Avalanche network consists of three individual blockchains: the X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. Each chain has a distinct purpose, which is radically different from the approach Bitcoin and Ethereum use, namely having all nodes validate all transactions. Avalanche blockchains even use different consensus mechanisms based on their use cases. 

After its mainnet launch in 2020, Avalanche has worked on developing its own ecosystem of [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) and [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/defi). Different Ethereum-based projects such as SushiSwap and TrueUSD have integrated with Avalanche. Furthermore, the platform is constantly working on improving interoperability between its own ecosystem and Ethereum, like through the development of [bridges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bridges). 

## Avalanche Built-in Blockchains and Subnets

Avalanche has three primary built-in blockchains.

### Exchange Chain (X-Chain)

Used to send and receive funds on the Avalanche network, which is the X-Chain's only function. Additionally, transaction fees are fixed at 0.001 AVAX, and X-Chain provides speed benefits over C-Chain. X-Chain uses [directed acyclic graph](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/directed-acyclic-graph-dag) (DAG) technology.

### Platform Chain (P-Chain)

Used for staking AVAX and facilitating validator activities. Users can become a validator or defer to one to collect their AVAX rewards on the P-Chain.

### Contract Chain (C-Chain)

Avalanche's chain for decentralized finance, as it is the chain used for smart contract and [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) apps. Most of Avalanche DApps are housed here and compatible with MetaMask.

These three networks are secured and validated by the Primary Network, a special subnet. All custom subnets need to validate on the Primary Network by staking at least 2,000 AVAX.

Avalanche subnets, or subnetworks, are dynamic sets of [validators](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/validator) working together to achieve [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) on the state of a set of [blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain). Every blockchain is validated by one subnet, whereas one subnet can validate various blockchains. Validator nodes can be a member of multiple subnets.

Every subnet validator has an incentive to adhere to an individual subnet's security and resource requirements. Every subnet can customize these incentives and may include token rewards, governance, etc. 

Subnets aims to bring application-specific networks to the broader Avalanche ecosystem. For example, an individual application, product, or service may require certain validator properties, such as memory or internet bandwidth. Validators meeting those requirements can join the Subnet to ensure smooth operations. Additionally, Subnets may have a native token economy and customized fee markets.

Avalanche Subnets also support private blockchain development, in which predefined validators join. Those validators are the only ones who can see the content of that private blockchain, an option for organizations who want to keep sensitive information private.

## Who Are the Founders of Avalanche?

Avalanche was launched by Ava Labs, founded by Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer, and Cornell University computer science PhD’s Kevin Sekniqi and Maofan “Ted” Yin. Gün Sirer is a veteran in cryptographic research, having designed a conceptual peer-to-peer virtual currency six years before the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper. He was also involved in work on Bitcoin scaling solutions and research on Ethereum before the infamous The DAO hack in 2016. 

From that research arose the whitepaper that led to the foundation of Ava Labs in 2018. The project closed a seed round in February 2019 that included investors such as Polychain, Andreessen Horowitz and Balaji Srinivasan. Avalanche closed its initial coin offering in 2020 in under 24 hours, raising $42 million in the process. 


## What Makes Avalanche Unique?

Avalanche attempts to solve the [blockchain trilemma](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/blockchain-trilemma), which posits that blockchains cannot achieve a sufficient degree of decentralization at scale. A consequence of this are high gas fees, as is often the case on Ethereum. 

To solve this problem, Avalanche designed three interoperable blockchains.



* The Exchange Chain (X-Chain) is employed to create and exchange the native AVAX tokens and other assets. Similar to the ERC-20 standard on Ethereum, these tokens follow a set of standardized rules. It uses the Avalanche consensus mechanism.
* The Contract Chain (C-Chain) hosts smart contracts and decentralized applications. It has its own Avalanche Virtual Machine, similar to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing developers to fork EVM-compatible DApps. It uses the Snowman consensus mechanism.
* The Platform Chain (P-Chain) coordinates network validators, tracks active subnets and enables the creation of new subnets. Subnets are sets of validators, sort of like a validator cartel. Each subnet can be validating several blockchains, but a blockchain can only be validated by one subnet. It also uses the Snowman consensus mechanism.

This division of computing tasks enables higher [throughput](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/throughput) without compromising on decentralization. For instance, private blockchains on the network could require its subnet’s validators to be sufficiently geographically decentralized or comply with certain regulations. Following this modular structure, Avalanche improves its interoperability with other blockchains wishing to integrate with the Avalanche ecosystem. Furthermore, the two different consensus mechanisms are designed with each blockchain’s requirements in mind, further improving their efficiency.

## How Many Avalanche (AVAX) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The total supply of AVAX is 720 million. Its token distribution is as follows:



* 2.5% - seed sale, with 10% released on mainnet launch and the rest being released every three months.
* 3.5% - private sale, with 10% released on mainnet launch and the rest being released every three months.
* 10% - public sale, with 10% released on mainnet launch and 15% released every three months over a period of 18 months.
* 9.26% - allocated to the foundation, released over ten years.
* 7% - community endowment, released over twelve months.
* 0.27% - testnet incentive program, released over one year.
* 5% - strategic partners, released over four years.
* 2.5% - airdrops, released over four years.
* 10% - team, released over four years.
* 50% staking rewards

Staking AVAX currently provides an annual reward of 11.57%, with the minimum time for staking being two weeks with a minimum of 2,000 AVAX.


## How Is the Avalanche Network Secured?

AVAX is traded on the Exchange Chain, which follows its own Avalanche consensus mechanism. Unlike proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, the Avalanche consensus mechanism does not have one leader processing transactions that get validated by others. Instead, all nodes process and validate transactions by employing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) protocol. That way, transactions are processed simultaneously, and validators' random polling ensures that transactions are correct with statistical certainty. There are no blocks in this consensus mechanism, allowing immediate finalization and significantly improving the blockchain’s speed.

UNUS SED LEO,LEO,unus-sed-leo,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3957.png,token,"## What Is UNUS SED LEO (LEO)?

** **

UNUS SED LEO is a utility token that’s used across the iFinex ecosystem. The unusual name is based on a Latin citation from one of Aesop’s fables.

 

The cryptocurrency allows Bitfinex users to save money on trading fees. The extent of the discount depends on how much LEO that the customer has in their account — and the savings on offer are spread across three tiers. There are fluctuations depending on whether a trading pair is crypto-to-crypto, or crypto-to stablecoin.

 

UNUS SED LEO launched in May 2019 — and unlike many other cryptocurrencies out there, it is not designed to exist forever.

 


## Who Are the Founders of UNUS SED LEO?

** **

UNUS SED LEO was founded by iFinex after Crypto Capital, the company that processed its payments, saw part of its funds seized by the government. IFinex is the parent company of Bitfinex, which warned that it may not be possible to recover these funds. To cover the financial shortfall, it decided to launch the LEO token.

 

To make good the money lost, iFinex unveiled plans to gradually buy back the token from investors until none are left circulating in the marketplace. A transparency initiative was also launched so the crypto community could monitor the initiative’s progress, and ensure it was meeting stated targets.


### What Makes UNUS SED LEO Unique?

 

A token burn mechanism means iFinex is committed to buying back UNUS SED LEO from the market on a monthly basis. The amount that’s purchased and burned is equal to at least 27% of the revenues generated by iFinex — and tokens are also purchased at the market rate. In a news release at the time, the company said: “The burn mechanism will continue until 100% of tokens have been redeemed.”

 

Whereas some cryptocurrencies just launch on a single blockchain, LEO tokens were issued on two blockchains. While 64% of the original supply was on Ethereum, the remaining 36% could be found on EOS.

## LEO Token Utility

The token offers taker fee reduction and lending fee reduction for all platforms, products and services provided by iFinex. Additionally, the LEO Token includes a withdrawal and deposit fee discount of up to 25% and a derivatives taker fee reduction. Furthermore, these discounts apply to Bitfinex and EOSfinex, as both platforms operate under the iFinex banner. Any future platforms built under the iFinex banner will offer similar discounts to LEO token holders. 

That deduction of up to 25% will be deducted in LEO first, assuming the trader has those tokens in their portfolio. Moreover, the withdrawal and deposit fee discounts are accessible to any user holding over $50 million worth of LEO tokens (on average over the past month) to withdraw up to $2 million without additional fees. Any amount above $2 million is subject to a 2% fee, rather than 3%. 

It is worth mentioning there is a LEO token [burn](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/burned) to deflate the supply over time. In the [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper), it is mentioned there are monthly token burns during which iFinex buys back LEO amounts equal to at least 27% of the consolidated gross revenue generated by iFinex the previous month.


### How Many UNUS SED LEO (LEO) Coins Are There in Circulation?

 

As we mentioned, the circulating supply of LEO tokens is designed to diminish over time. Originally, the total supply was set at 1 billion.

 

LEO was sold for $1 apiece on a 1:1 basis with the Tether stablecoin, meaning that a total of $1 billion was raised over a 10-day period.

 

There were 660 million ERC-20 tokens at launch, as well as 340 million EOS-based tokens — and Bitfinex allows conversions between the two chains to be made with ease.

 

At the time, the company described the dual protocol launch as “unique” — and vowed that it would empower the Bitfinex community.


### How Is the UNUS SED LEO Network Secured?

** **

These tokens are based on Ethereum and EOS respectively. A dashboard has been released by Bitfinex that offers up-to-minute information on the current supply, and how many LEO tokens have been burned. Bar charts compare LEO burns on a daily basis.


### Where Can You Buy UNUS SED LEO?

TrueUSD,TUSD,trueusd,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2563.png,token,"## What Is TrueUSD (TUSD)?

TUSD is the first digital asset with live on-chain attestations by independent third-party institutions and is backed 1:1 with the U.S. dollar (USD). So far, it has been listed on more than 100 trading platforms such as Binance and Huobi and is live on 12 mainstream public chains, including Ethereum, TRON, Avalanche, BSC, Fantom, and Polygon. 

TrueUSD is attested to in real-time by an independent, industry-specialized accounting firm in the U.S., to ensure the 1:1 ratio of its USD reserve to the circulating token supply and the 100% collateral rate. With the integration of Chainlink PoR, TrueUSD becomes the first USD-Backed stablecoin to secure minting and further ensure transparency and reliability. Users can access the relevant data via the official website tusd.io at any time. TUSD is granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the Commonwealth of Dominica, a country in the Caribbean, effective on October 7th 2022.

#### How Many TrueUSD (TUSD) Coins Are There in Circulation?

There was around 2 billion TUSD in circulation as of March 2023. Given its status as a stablecoin, the supply is uncapped, and will continue to expand according to demand.


### How Is the TrueUSD Network Secured?

TrustToken aims to deliver maximum transparency using tools such as real-time auditing of TUSD’s backing and reliability. 

Beyond trusting the validity of its USD peg, any security issues relate to those which affect all ERC-20 standard tokens. Transactions, for example, can suffer from abnormally high fees if [gas prices](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) on the Ethereum blockchain spike.


### Where Can You Buy TrueUSD (TUSD)?

As one of the largest USD stablecoins, TUSD is freely available on major exchanges, with pairs for cryptocurrencies and other stablecoins available.

ApeCoin,APE,apecoin-ape,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/18876.png,token,"##What Is ApeCoin?

ApeCoin is an ERC-20 governance and utility token used within the [APE Ecosystem](http://apecoin.com/) to empower and incentivize a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3.  
 
ApeCoin holders govern themselves via the decentralized governance framework controlling the ApeCoin DAO, and vote on how the ApeCoin DAO Ecosystem Fund should be used. The APE Foundation administers proposals agreed upon by ApeCoin holders.
 
 
##Who Are the Founders of ApeCoin?

ApeCoin is a decentralized project inspired by Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club project. ApeCoin was founded to be used within the burgeoning APE Ecosystem, which is supported by the APE Foundation. The ApeCoin DAO aims to build and maintain the APE Ecosystem in a fair and inclusive way, providing an infrastructure for ApeCoin holders to collaborate through open and permissionless governance processes.

An administrative council within the APE Foundation (the “Board”), will carry out the decisions of ApeCoin DAO members. The Board is responsible for the day-to-day administration, bookkeeping, project management, and other tasks that ensure the Community’s ideas have the support they need to become a reality. ApeCoin DAO members vote on Board members. 


##What Makes ApeCoin Unique?

ApeCoin is the APE Ecosystem’s governance token, allowing token holders to participate in ApeCoin DAO and giving its participants a shared and open currency that can be used without centralized intermediaries. 62% of all ApeCoin was allocated to the Ecosystem Fund, which will support community-driven initiatives as voted on by ApeCoin DAO members.
 
ApeCoin also gives access to certain parts of the Ecosystem that are otherwise unavailable, like exclusive games and services. For third-party developers, ApeCoin is a tool to participate in the ecosystem by incorporating ApeCoin into services, games, and other projects.
 
The APE Foundation was gifted a 1 of 1 NFT by Yuga Labs, the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club. Yuga Labs has conveyed all rights and privileges to this [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mint-an-nft) and its underlying artwork to the APE Foundation. The ApeCoin DAO members can decide how this intellectual property is used. 
 
 
##How Many ApeCoin Are There in Circulation?

The total supply of ApeCoin is permanently fixed at 1 billion tokens, all minted at once.
 
On launch day, March 17, 2022, 30.25% will be in circulation. This percentage will continually increase following launch day at regular intervals over a 48-month period. 
 
The amount of ApeCoin in circulation is a dynamic number that will constantly change both due to the aforementioned schedule and a myriad of market factors.

 
##How Is the ApeCoin Network Secured?

ApeCoin is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token launched on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain. As a result, it is secured by Ethereum’s [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POW) consensus mechanism.

In addition, it forms a network between small and medium-sized churches that have been disconnected and enables flexible collaboration among ecosystem participants with the same purpose within the faith, such as churches, religious organizations, non-profit organizations, and media production companies, through the blockchain ecosystem.

Talent will build a blockchain-based trading and payment system in the platform to resolve traffic issues that can be caused by a large number of downloads of huge videos or audio files or a high increase in the number of users, protect the copyright of the content via Smart Contract and secure the safety and transparency of the trades on the Talent Store with the distributed ledger.

Ribbon Finance,RBN,ribbon-finance,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/12387.png,token,"# What is Ribbon Finance?

Ribbon uses financial engineering to create structured products that deliver sustainable yield. Ribbon's first product focuses on yield through automated options strategies. The protocol also allows developers to create arbitrary structured products through combining various DeFi derivatives.

Structured products are packaged financial instruments that use a combination of derivatives to achieve some specific risk-return objective, such as betting on volatility, enhancing yields or principal protection.

Theta Vault is a new product that automates a covered call strategy to earn high yield on ETH. The vault runs a covered call strategy and sells out of the money call options on a weekly basis for yield.

The primary risk for running this strategy is that depositors could potentially give up upside in exchange for guaranteed yield. By selling a call option, users are basically promising to sell the asset at the strike price, even if it goes above it (a.k.a selling early). Because of this, if the price of the asset moves up significantly in a short period of time, it is possible for depositors to have ""negative yield"" on their ETH.

However, this only happens if ETH/USD appreciates significantly, so depositors will still be up in USD terms. The vault also sells call options that are very out of the money, which means there is a relatively low chance of the options getting exercised.

## Security

The smart contracts are audited by OpenZeppelin, Peckshield, ChainSafe and Quantstamp. Despite that, users are advised to exercise caution and only risk funds they can afford to lose.","{""website"":[""https://www.ribbon.finance/""],""technical_doc"":[""https://docs.ribbon.finance/""],""explorer"":[""https://etherscan.io/token/0x6123b0049f904d730db3c36a31167d9d4121fa6b""],""source_code"":[""https://github.com/ribbon-finance""],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/RibbonFinance"",""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/ribbon-finance"",""https://ribbonfinance.medium.com/""],""chat"":[""https://discord.com/invite/aevo""],""announcement"":[],""reddit"":[],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/ribbonfinance""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1027.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x6123b0049f904d730db3c36a31167d9d4121fa6b"",""ContractPlatform"":""Ethereum"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://etherscan.io/token/0x6123b0049f904d730db3c36a31167d9d4121fa6b""}]","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9022.png"",""Name"":""Trust Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.trustwallet.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9025.png"",""Name"":""MetaMask"",""URL"":""https://metamask.io/""}]",[]
Theta Network,THETA,theta-network,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2416.png,coin,"## What Is Theta (THETA)?

Theta (THETA) is a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) powered network purpose-built for video streaming. Launched in March 2019, the Theta mainnet operates as a decentralized network in which users share bandwidth and computing resources on a peer-to-peer ([P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p)) basis. The project is advised by Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube and Justin Kan, co-founder of Twitch.

Theta features its own native cryptocurrency token, THETA, which performs various governance tasks within the network, and counts Google, Binance, Blockchain ventures, Gumi, Sony Europe and Samsung as Enterprise validators, along with a Guardian network of thousands of community-run guardian nodes.

Developers say that the project aims to shake up the video streaming industry in its current form — centralization, poor infrastructure and high costs mean that end users often end up with a poor experience. Content creators likewise earn less revenue due to the barriers between them and end users.

The Theta team has created a customer-centric business plan for their growing ecosystem of services focused on esports, music, TV, movies, and education. The list of Theta Network partners includes video platforms like Samsung VR, Cinedigm, Shout! Factory, Pandora.tv, Play Labs, and THETA.tv.

### Who Are The Founders of Theta?

Theta was co-founded by Mitch Liu and Jieyi Long in 2018. Liu has a long history in the gaming and video industries, co-founding video advertising firm Tapjoy, mobile social gaming startup Gameview Studios, and THETA.tv, the live streaming platform whose [DApp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) was the first to be built on the Theta protocol.

Long is Theta’s second co-founder and CTO, following similar multi-year experience in design automation, gaming, virtual reality, and large scale distributed systems. He authored multiple peer-reviewed academic papers and holds various patents in video streaming, blockchain and virtual reality.

Theta now has a modest team, and its official website lists strategic corporate investors as Samsung NEXT, Sony Innovation Fund, media investors BDMI Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments, CAA Creative Artists Agency, and traditional Silicon Valley VCs including DCM, Sierra Ventures and the VR Fund.

#### What Makes Theta Unique?

Theta’s main business concept is to decentralize video streaming, data delivery and edge computing, making it more efficient, cost-effective and fair for industry participants.

The network runs on a native blockchain, with two native tokens, known as Theta (THETA), Theta Fuel (TFUEL), powering the internal economy.

Theta’s appeal is threefold: viewers get rewarded with better quality streaming service, content creators improve their earnings and middlemen — video platforms — save money on building infrastructure and increase advertising and subscription revenues.

Users have an incentive to both watch network content and share network resources, as rewards come in the form of TFUEL tokens.

The platform is open source, and token holders receive governance powers as with many [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoS)-based blockchain ecosystems.

In addition to video, data and computing, Theta caters to developers looking to launch decentralized applications (DApps) on its fully featured EVM-compatible Smart contract platform.

### How Does Theta Network Work?

The Theta ecosystem includes the following types of participants: Influencers (content creators), Viewers (end-users who consume video content), Advertisers (sponsor influencers and place ads on the platform), Caching Nodes (computers/servers that help improve content quality and delivery speed), Ingest Nodes (assists Caching Nodes and also provides bitrates/stream resolution).

Since the protocol is open-source, any provider can use the Theta blockchain and create decentralized applications ([dApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) on the platform. Users are rewarded in THETA tokens for sharing videos through the decentralized video streaming dApp for transcription and distribution of content called EdgeCast.

Theta aims to reduce the operating costs of streaming video services. The load on a content delivery network (CDN) can be reduced by moving some content to the peer-to-peer network. The platform operates on thousands of nodes, which makes the network resilient to content delivery failures and solves the problem of digital last-mile delivery.

At the heart of Theta is a peer-to-peer ([P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2phttps://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p)) protocol that is responsible for content distribution and transaction processing. The Theta blockchain uses a modified Proof-of-Stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) consensus mechanism like the staking-based Tendermint system.


### Theta Network Nodes

The most important component of the platform is a mesh network. It consists of a set of nodes that connects the network into an integral ecosystem, ensuring the function to share bandwidth. Theta Network nodes are users who provide various equipment/resources and are rewarded for sharing bandwidth and attracting new participants to the platform. Nodes cache and relay video data.

Theta Network is powered by three types of nodes: Edge Nodes, Enterprise Validator Nodes, and Guardian Nodes.

Edge Nodes are hosted by members of the community. They are the most numerous. This type of participant shares their bandwidth or relays video streams over the network in exchange for TFUEL tokens. TFUEL is the of two native tokens on the Theta blockchain, a utility token designed to support operations.

Enterprise Validator Nodes are one of Theta's security layers, companies that stake THETA tokens and get the right to process transactions. This group is also responsible for producing new blocks on the chain. Currently, Validator Nodes include Google, Samsung, Creative Artists Agency, and Sony.

Guardian Nodes allow accurate block operation and maintain consensus by adding the second layer of security, right after Enterprise Validator Nodes.

#### How Many Theta (THETA) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Theta Network is based on a dual token system, where THETA is the protocol’s governance token. With THETA, the community determines the direction of development. Meanwhile, TFUEL is a micropayment currency. It’s used to perform all operations on the network. Whenever users share content, Theta encourages it and gives them an opportunity to earn rewards in TFUEL. To earn TFUEL, THETA holders must join either Guardian Nodes or Validator Nodes, which will allow them to participate in transaction validation and block creation.

THETA exists only for governance purposes, with 5 TFUEL tokens issued per 1 THETA held at the time of the mainnet launch in 2019.

THETA itself launched in 2018, at which time it was distributed to buyers as an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). Afterwards, all ERC-20 THETA were converted to native THETA on the mainnet.

The total supply of THETA is capped at 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. It is distributed in various proportions among all network participants, as well as the Theta team itself and a reserve pool.

TFUEL is used to power transactions in a similar way to [gas](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) on Ethereum (ETH). Its total supply is 5 billion (5,000,000,000) tokens.


### How Is the Theta Network Secured?

Theta uses a financial incentive scheme to ensure user participation in governance activities, and hence its network is secured by its own users.

The network relies on proof-of-stake (PoS), and employs a multi-level Byzantine Fault Tolerance ([BFT](BFT)) consensus mechanism to balance security with high transaction throughput.

With the launch of Guardian nodes in June 2019, Theta ensured that no single entity controls the majority of THETA tokens being staked at any one time.


### Where Can You Buy Theta (THETA)?

THETA, as the main token for the Theta platform, is freely tradable on major exchanges. Pairs include cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies and stablecoins. 

As of October 2020, the highest volume pairs come from [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), with the most popular trading currency being stablecoin Tether (USDT).

Chiliz,CHZ,chiliz,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/4066.png,token,"## What Is Chiliz (CHZ)?

[Chiliz](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chiliz/) is the leading digital currency for sports and entertainment by the eponymous Malta-based FinTech provider. It operates the blockchain-based sports entertainment platform Socios, which enables users to participate in the governance of their favorite sports brands. Multiple [fan tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-fan-tokens) by [Socios.com](https://www.socios.com/) are an example of that. For sports clubs and associations, fan tokens offer a way of connecting with their fans and unlocking new revenue streams. 

For instance, fans can participate and influence club-related decisions through surveys and polls, such as messages the captain should wear on his armband. The company aims to bridge the gap between being an active and a passive fan. Chiliz has developed partnerships with some of the biggest sporting institutions in the world: [FC Barcelona](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fc-barcelona-fan-token/), [Manchester City](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/manchester-city-fan-token/), [Juventus Turin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/juventus-fan-token/), and [Paris Saint-Germain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/paris-saint-germain-fan-token/). It also boasts partnerships with the UFC and gaming organizations. By purchasing CHZ, fans get access to various fan tokens and literally have a stake in their club.


## Who Are the Founders of Chiliz (CHZ)?

Chiliz was founded by Alexandre Dreyfus, its current CEO. Dreyfus has over 20 years of experience founding and growing web-based companies. For instance, he developed Webcity, an interactive travel guide, and Winamax and Chilipoker, both online poker projects, before founding Chiliz in 2017. His explicit goal with the company is to “work harder than ever on our mission to fully establish Fan Tokens as the ultimate fan engagement tool and as a powerful new revenue generator for the sports industry.” This has been highlighted in the aggressive expansion of fan tokens that have seen numerous European football powerhouses, but also smaller clubs sign on. 


## What Makes Chiliz (CHZ) Unique?

Every sporting organization using the Chiliz technology has a limited supply of fan tokens that are offered at an initial FTO (fan token offering). These tokens are offered on a first-come-first-serve basis, with the opening price and fully diluted market cap disclosed by Chiliz beforehand. The native CHZ token is used to purchase fan tokens and acts as the platform’s internal currency. Fans can then vote on the Socios platform with their fan tokens, a process made possible using [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). Clubs determine the amount of influence fans have. Decisions can range from new jersey designs to deciding team matchups in exhibition games.

Chiliz pioneered direct participation for average sport fans in the decision-making process of clubs and organizations. The company is constantly creating new ways for fans to engage, with the establishment of the Chiliz Blockchain Campus, a privately-owned crypto incubator focused on accelerating blockchain technology adoption across Asia and Europe as an example. The company estimates to be at about 10% of its potential, despite the fact that it will likely have 80-100 teams as a part of its network by the end of 2021.

## How Many Chiliz (CHZ) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The total supply of CHZ is 8.8 billion, minted at its launch in October 2018 and distributed to early contributors with no public sales beyond what was made available through exchanges. The token distribution is as follows: 

15 % – Strategic Acquisitions

5% – Team

7% – Seed investors

3% – Advisory board

15% – Marketing

20% – Userbase reserve

34.5% – Token sale

Initially, CHZ launched as [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, but it was later also designed to be [BEP-2](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bep-2-binance-chain-tokenization-standard) compatible, owning Binance Launchpool’s role in releasing fan tokens as part of a strategic partnership. CHZ is also available as [TRC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/) token on the Tron blockchain. 


## How Is the Chiliz Network Secured?

CHZ is available on several blockchains, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Tron. Fan tokens are minted on its Socios [sidechain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/side-chain) with a proprietary crowd control mechanism, so fans are in a protected environment and vote only in publicly audited polls. The sidechain uses a [proof-of-authority](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-authority-poa) consensus mechanism. Proof-of-authority is mostly used by private organizations that have closed blockchains and only users within its ecosystem participating. It is less decentralized than other consensus mechanisms but is easily scalable and highly secure, making it the ideal choice for a sidechain. The CHZ token has been [audited by Certik](https://www.certik.org/projects/chiliz).


## When Will Chiliz Trading Begin?

Chiliz launched in October 2018 on the Ethereum mainnet. 


## Where Can You Buy Chiliz (CHZ)?

CHZ is available on [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/)  and many other exchanges.

MonaCoin,MONA,monacoin,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/213.png,coin,"## What Is MonaCoin (MONA)?

MonaCoin (MONA) is an open-source decentralized cryptocurrency and a [peer-to-peer](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-peer-to-peer-p2p) (p2p) payment network. Launched in January 2014 with no pre-mine process, MonaCoin is built on an algorithm called Lyra2RE (v2), and is based on a hard fork of Litecoin. 

The MonaCoin payment network is entirely decentralized. Like most decentralized projects, it doesn’t belong to one single person, but belongs to all users. Moreover, the peer-to-peer technology behind MONA makes the platform independent and self-governing. New coins are issued collectively with the users of the system as payment for mining. 

Miners earn 25 coins for every 90 blocks processed; block generation time is 1.5 minutes and mining difficulty depends on each block.

The MonaCoin community is the most active and engaged cryptocurrency user association in Japan with impressive support from local investors and crypto enthusiasts. The project gained public attention when it was featured on the WBS TV Network Tokyo, which presented the story of a man who bought a piece of land in Nagano with MonaCoin.

Who Are the Founders of MonaCoin?

MonaCoin was launched on January 1, 2014, based on a cat-like internet meme -- specifically, the popular ASCII art character, Mona.

MONA is the first alternative cryptocurrency developed in Japan. The project was created covertly by a user named 'Mr. Wantanabe'. As of October 2021, the development team remains completely anonymous. There is no information about the founder, no details about the number of participants as well. The names, photos or social media pages of the MonaCoin team are not available.

What Makes MonaCoin Unique?

MonaCoin (MONA) is a cryptocurrency developed in Japan that has earned a reputation and has gathered a community of fans mainly in its homeland. Due to the formidable fanbase, MonaCoin users managed to create several MONA-based web applications and services, which significantly increased the utility of the project.

**Distinctive features of MonaCoin include:**

**Fast transaction processing.** The blocking time for MONA is 1.5 minutes. Plus-- MonaCoin supports both public and private transactions.

**Widespread deployment.** The cryptocurrency has existed since 2013. Therefore, over the years, MONA has pursued the goal of becoming a convenient and inexpensive cryptocurrency for the Japanese audience.

**Dedicated community.** MonaCoin is supported by its community, relying primarily on its supportive and loyal users, in contrast to projects that rely on the support of an outside development team and third-party system.

MonaCoin is a hard fork of [Litecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/), and Litecoin is a hard fork of [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), however, MonaCoin has a much larger circulating and maximum supply than Bitcoin and Litecoin. Moreover, MonaCoin operates on its own hashing algorithm.

How Many MonaCoin (MONA) Coins Are There in Circulation?

MonaCoin (MONA) is a meme coin with real-world use. The project combines decentralization and a convenient payment system with instant transactions. 

The maximum supply that will ever be released to the market is 105,120,000 $MONA (physical and digital). MonaCoin doesn’t have a pre-mining process, so developers and users are on equal terms to receive MONA. Tokens can be mined via special mining software; coins can be purchased from major cryptocurrency exchanges.

MonaCoin uses Lyra2RE (v2) and Dark Gravity Wave (v3) algorithms to provide fair mining opportunities, success rates and increasing difficulty levels with every new block. Every 1.5 minutes, 25 MONA is mined and miners earn 25 MONA for every 90 blocks processed.

MonaCoin has been approved by Japan's Financial Services Agency.

How Is the MonaCoin Network Secured?

Monacoin uses the Lyra2RE (v2) [Proof-of-Work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) algorithm for block approval, and PoW is the same system on which [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) is based. On top of that, Monacoin (MONA) can be safely stored in the following Hardware wallets: Ledger Nano X and Nano S.

The company has been in the cryptosphere since 2014 and has already secured the support of a huge fan base centered in Japan. The users are aware that the team is anonymous, but are confident in its security. MonaCoin was launched without pre-mining, so there are no hidden coins that the team can use in the future and dump on the market. Furthermore, over the years, MonaCoin has established itself as a reliable project that has never suffered from a hacking incident.

SingularityNET,AGIX,singularitynet,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2424.png,token,"## What Is SingularityNET (AGIX)?

SingularityNET is a [blockchain-powered](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) platform that allows anybody to easily ""create, share, and monetize"" AI services, thanks to its globally-accessible AI marketplace.

Through the SingularityNET marketplace, users can browse, test and purchase a huge variety of AI services using the platform’s native utility token — AGIX. Moreover, the marketplace represents an outlet AI developers can use to publish and sell their AI tools, and easily track their performance. 

The team behind SingularityNET pioneered the development of an AI known as Sophia, which is described as the ""world's most expressive robot"". SingularityNET’s goal is to enable Sophia to be able to fully understand human language, and continue developing “OpenCog” — an AI framework that is hoped to eventually achieve a state known as “advanced general intelligence,” i.e. human-level artificial intelligence (or beyond). 

The platform was first announced in 2017 and completed an initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) in December the same year, raising $36 million in just one minute. 


### Who Are the Founders of SingularityNET?

SingularityNET has an extensive team largely of AI scientists, developers, researchers and engineers. 

It was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel (SingularityNET's CEO and chief scientist) in addition to Simone Giacomelli and Dr. David Hanson.

Dr. Ben Goertzel is an established figure in the AI and robotics industry and has a long distinguished track record of working with advanced technology companies — including Hanson Robotics and the OpenCog Foundation. He also works as Mozi Health's chief scientist and vice chairman for Humanity+.

Simone Giacomelli is an entrepreneur and investor that previously worked for crypto consultancy Cryptodex. He left the SingularityNET project in March 2019 and is now focused on the technology R&D lab Vulpem, which he founded in 2015.

Dr. David Hanson is SingularityNET's third co-founder. He has a long and varied history in the robotics industry, working with Disney between 1998 and 2001 before founding several robotics startups — including Human Emulation Robotics, Initiative for Awakening Machines and Hanson Robotics over the last two decades.


#### What Makes SingularityNET Unique?

SingularityNET is the first platform that makes it easy for developers to sell their AI tools and libraries and enables buyers to test any AI service provided on the marketplace to see if it meets their needs before making payment. 

On top of this, those in need of specific AI services can also tap SingularityNET’s extensive community of AI specialists through the Request for AI portal (RFAI) — which allows customers to easily commission a new AI tool, while developers can earn AGIX tokens by filling these requests. 

The utility of the AGIX token has evolved with the development of the SingularityNET ecosystem. In October 2020, SingularityNET launched its SingularityNET Enhancement Proposal (SNEP) feature, enabling AGIX holders to vote on changes to the network’s operations. Whereas in March 2020, a staking feature was added, enabling users to stake their tokens 

In a collaboration with Hanson Robotics, SingularityNET recently released a joint venture known as Awakening Health, which develops products that leverage AI for healthcare purposes. Its first product is Grace, a humanoid assistant for the healthcare industry.

#### How Many SingularityNET (AGIX) Coins Are There in Circulation?

As of February 2021, a total of 861.5 million AGIX tokens representing 86% of the total supply were in circulation. As such, AGIX can be considered largely diluted.

Half (50%) of the total AGIX supply was sold during SingularityNET's 2017 ICO. Beyond this 20% was reserved for early developer and partner incentives, 18% for the core team members (now fully vested), 8% for the SingularityNET foundation for the long-term development of the platform, whereas the last 4% was reserved for security bounties.


### How Is SingularityNET Network Secured?

AGIX is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token. 

This means it’s backed by the Ethereum [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) (PoS) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm and battle-tested network of validators. To date, the Ethereum network has never been successfully [attacked](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack) and is considered one of the most secure networks currently operating. 

The team behind SingularityNET has hinted that SingularityNET may move to another blockchain in the future, and recently [announced](https://blog.singularitynet.io/singularitynet-collaborates-with-iohk-to-explore-cardano-agi-synergies-8bd1570ffab2) it was exploring the possibility of launching on the delegated proof-of-stake ([dPoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos)) [Cardano](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/) blockchain. 


### Where Can You Buy SingularityNET (AGIX)?

The AGIX token is available to trade on several prominent exchange platforms, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), KuCoin, and HitBTC. It's also available on two of the most popular [DEXs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) — [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) and Balancer. Currently, the only available trading pairs for AGIX are AGIX/BTC, AGIX/ETH, and AGIX/WETH. 

It is not currently possible to purchase AGIX directly with your credit or debit card from any of these exchange platforms, but you may be able to buy [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) first, and then exchange this for AGIX.

USDJ,USDJ,usdj,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5446.png,token,"## What Is USDJ (USDJ)?

In the whitepaper, USDJ is described as a USD-pegged [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin) backed by collateral assets, generated through decentralized smart contracts on the TRON network. ""Anyone can pledge [TRX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/) as [collateral](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/collateral) to generate USDJ."" It is reportedly pegged to the US dollar through [Collateralized Debt Positions](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/collateralized-debt-position-cdp) (CDPs), and has autonomous feedback mechanisms. The vision behind USDJ is to make it an integral piece of the [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) ecosystem on TRON.

USDJ is part of the [JUST](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/just/) DeFi ecosystem on Tron, which consists of JustStable and the JustLend DAO.


## Who Are the Founders of USDJ?

USDJ is a product of the JUST network ecosystem. It is developed by the JUST Foundation, which consists of a vibrant and talented team with experience from Alibaba, Tencent and IBM.


## How Does USDJ Work?

As laid out in its whitepaper, to generate USDJ, one must deposit collateral assets into Collateralized Debt Positions (CDP) as part of the process. Users first convert TRX to PTRX. To generate USDJ, users carry out a transaction to JUST and create a CDP. Then execute another transaction in order to deposit PTRX, the collateral asset into that same CDP. When a CDP holder sends a transaction to create USDJ, the same amount of debt is also generated and collateral assets are locked up until repayment. Thereby, making that particular asset unavailable for redemption.

USDJ also has a price stability mechanism in place. USDJ is initially pegged 1-to-1 to the US dollar. In times of market instability, a Target Rate Feedback Mechanism (TRFM) will be deployed to keep its denomination constant. 


## What Makes USDJ Unique?

When the USDJ price received from Oracles is different from the real US Dollar rate, [JST](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/just/) token holders can initiate a global settlement mechanism to mitigate any potential risks and damages; this process comes in three steps:

First, the global settlement mechanism is activated after which CDP holders are unable to create or modify their positions. Meanwhile, the price feed will be preserved at a fixed value in order to process all users' claims accurately and promptly.

Second, keepers in the JUST system will use a price feed to auction off all debt and collateral assets in a decentralized manner, thus granting settlement for USDJ and CDP holders' claims.

Subsequently, to Keepers handling Global Settlement claims, all USDJ and CDP holders can file a claim petition on JUST in order to exchange their USDJ or CDPs for an unchanging quantity of TRX depending upon the Target Price of USDJ. There is no deadline set as far as when users must take this step.

The USDJ stablecoin system is also equipped with a comprehensive risk-management program. JST holders who are part of the JUST governance system fully control the key decisions to regulate risks in the entire ecosystem. These steps include modification of sensitivity parameters through the Target Rate Feedback Mechanism (TRFM), modification of Target Rate, choosing trusted oracles, and other security mechanisms outlined in the official whitepaper.

## How Is the USDJ Network Secured?

USDJ is a [TRC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/trc-20-token) token issued on the [Tron](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/) blockchain. TRON is secured by a [delegated-proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos) (DPoS) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) mechanism, which uses a network of 27 super representatives (SRs) to verify transactions and package them into blocks. These Super Representatives are voted into position through an open election.

Mina,MINA,mina,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/8646.png,coin,"## What Is Mina Protocol?

Mina Protocol is a minimal “succinct blockchain” built to curtail computational requirements in order to run DApps more efficiently. Mina has been described as the world’s lightest blockchain since its size is designed to remain constant despite growth in usage. Furthermore, it remains balanced in terms of security and decentralization. The project was rebranded from Coda Protocol to Mina in October 2020. 

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Mina Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-mina-protocol).

The Mina network has a size of only 22 KB, which is miniscule when compared to Bitcoin’s 300 GB blockchain.


## What Is Mina Protocol’s Main Objective?

Mina is working on achieving an efficient distributed payment system that enables users to natively verify the platform right from the genesis block. Its technical whitepaper calls this a “succinct blockchain.”

The protocol uses Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs), a cryptographic proof that enables someone to authenticate information without revealing said information. However, enabling a user to trace the platform back to its genesis block can be impractical in a large network. As such, Mina incrementally computes SNARKS that concentrate only on the last few blocks — meaning that end-users check that zk-SNARK-compressed proof, instead of a block’s entire transaction history. 


At the heart of Mina protocol is MINA, its native currency, which functions as a utility coin and medium of exchange.


## How Does Mina Protocol Function?

Mina is similar to Bitcoin, apart from how it handles transactions, but also employs the account model used in Ethereum.

In this respect, the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that the state of the Bitcoin blockchain contains a list of unspent coins, while Ethereum’s state is made up of account balances.

Mina, on the other hand, uses a prover (or snarker, if you will), an equivalent of a miner, to ensure each block commits to the state. 

Mina employs the Ouroboros Samasika, a type of PoS mechanism specially designed for succinct decentralized networks since it provides bootstrapping from a genesis block.

Succinct blockchains contain two major functions: verify and update. Verification touches on consensus, blockchain summary and blocks, while the update function interacts with consensus and chain summary.

Apart from the above implementations, the project uses a parallel scan state to optimize transaction processing speed, which works by grouping unproven blocks and assigning the process to parallel provers.


## Major Mina Protocol Participants

Mina is all about revolutionizing the current blockchain landscape where most platforms have verifiers such as miners/stakers and light clients who act as third parties when verifying transactions.


Mina takes a different approach by having multiple participants, each handling a specific function on the decentralized network.


The three major roles include verifiers, block producers and snarkers.


* Verifiers
* Verifiers interact with zk-SNARKS that deal with certifying the consensus information. Each Mina protocol user is considered a verifier, provided that their devices can handle a 22 KB chain and withstand a few milliseconds of processing time. 


## Block Producers

Block producers take the form of stakers or miners and earn block rewards and transaction fee payments. Interestingly, the protocol doesn’t slash incentives that go to block producers. This category of participants allows Mina users to delegate their coins to them.  



Apart from bundling transactions into blocks, block producers also have to SNARK an equivalent number of previously committed trades as failure to do so during block production would lead to incomplete blocks and other nodes rejecting their validity. 


If a block producer wants to incorporate 10 transactions on the chain, they must also SNARK trades from the front of the queue. However, they have the option to produce the SNARK or use those generated by a special group of participants called snarkers.


‍## Snarkers

Snarkers, also known as provers, produce zk-SNARKs used in verifying transactions. 

Block producers pay snarkers from the overall transaction fees they receive for adding new blocks. However, to qualify for the fees, they have to post bids. Note that a snarker’s zk-SNARK needs to be used in a block while the block producer who uses it is responsible for incentivizing the snarker.


This creates a business economy where multiple snarkers can post bids tied to the same transaction. Block producers, on the other hand, are in for the profits and will choose the bid with the lowest fees. Consequently, snarkers are challenged to produce low-cost SNARKS.


## How Transactions Happen On Mina

The process starts with a user initiating a transaction, after which the trade goes to the mempool, a pool of valid but unconfirmed transactions.

Next, snarkers take over by making proofs or SNARKS. The process follows with the selection of a block producer (BP) to bundle transactions into a block. Note that a BP sifts through the mempool for profitable transactions.

Then, the BP chooses a SNARK according to the rules in the consensus mechanism. 

Note that a block producer scans through the bids for the lowest-priced SNARK. In addition, recently added transactions have an updated SNARKS order book.

Next, it’s time to incorporate the SNARKS in a block, then add the block to the chain and update the network. Snarked transactions are removed from the chain to help keep the size of the protocol constant.

Then, the block producer upgrades the protocol’s zk-SNARKS.

Finally, the new block becomes immutably part of the chain.

IRISnet,IRIS,irisnet,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3874.png,coin,"## What Is IRISnet (IRIS)?

IRISnet is a service protocol and cryptocurrency, which was officially launched on Mar. 1, 2019. The primary purpose of the IRISnet protocol is to provide a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based, open network to small and medium businesses that are offering a wide variety of services.  

According to the official [IRISnet Whitepaper](https://github.com/irisnet/irisnet/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#iris-overview), the protocol aims to employ different public and consortium blockchains to bring the power of decentralized, open networks to thousands of businesses and freelance service providers. Interestingly, IRISnet was named after Iris, the personification of the rainbow and the messenger of the Gods in Greek mythology. 


### Who Are the Founders of IRISnet?

IRISnet was designed and developed by the team of tech experts behind [Bianjie AI](https://www.bianjie.ai/home), a Shanghai-based high-tech company founded in 2016. 

[Harriet Cao](https://twitter.com/harrietirisnet?lang=en) is a co-founder at Bianjie AI and one of the driving forces behind the IRISnet protocol establishment. She has been working on bringing modern solutions to problems in the financial sector, as well as blockchain-based solutions for healthcare institutions. Besides Bianjie AI, Harriet Cao is also heavily involved with the Blockchain Edge Analytics Network (BEAN). She focuses on the big-data aspect of IRISnet. 

Haifeng Xi is the other co-founder at Bianjie AI. He has proven expertise in developing  distributed systems and blockchain applications. Combined with Harriet Cao’s interest in big data, the two came up with the idea for IRISnet as a blockchain solution for small and medium businesses. 

Another integral part of the team behind IRISnet is Tendermint, the company behind the Tendermint consensus engine, as well as the developers of [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem), an ecosystem designed to facilitate blockchain app development.


#### What Makes IRISnet Unique?

IRISnet is an innovative read of what blockchain technology can bring to the business world. While most consortium blockchains are owned and operated by big conglomerates of companies, IRISnet aims to bring solutions to small business operations.

One of their latest developments is the IRITA, an enterprise blockchain bringing flexible digital asset modeling and privacy-centric data authorization to the business world. 

One of the IRISnet protocol’s main selling points is that it aims to combine both on and off-chain capabilities. While transactions are executed on the blockchain, data processing and business logic will be executed off-chain. In addition, IRISnet also offers products like a smart wallet for business operations.

#### How Many IRISnet Coins Are There in Circulation?

IRISnet announced an initial token supply of two billion IRIS tokens distributed in several key groups. According to the [IRISnet whitepaper](https://github.com/irisnet/irisnet/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#iris-overview), 25% of tokens were released for private sale,  15% were distributed among Bianjie AI team members and 15% are reserved to support the IRIS Foundation’s functions. Another 30% of issued tokens went towards ecosystem development, while 5% were dedicated to a special Cosmos Hub Airdrop. Finally, 25% of tokens went to the Tendermint developer team; however, most of these tokens will be vested in increments after the IRIS Hub launch.

According to the founders, proceeds from the private sale of IRISnet coins will be directed predominantly towards the improvement and further development of the IRIS network. 


### How Is the IRISnet Network Secured?

Like many popular altcoins, IRISnet is a delegated proof-of-stake ([dPoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos)) coin, based on the Tendermint Consensus. Tendermint emerged a little after the introduction of the [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) and [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) consensuses, and it aims to become an all-encompassing consensus engine.

A delegated proof-of-stake consensus depends on the reputation of nodes, thus eliminating misbehaving nodes as the process goes on. For a transaction to be completed on a dPOS consensus, stakeholders request action from a trusted validator, who then processes the transaction. Because of the reputation model, validators (nodes) are bound to perform accurately; otherwise, they are removed from the network. 


### Where Can You Buy IRISnet (IRIS)?

[Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) is one option for an exchange if you are looking to acquire some IRISnet coins, as around $2,226,424 of IRISnet have already been traded through the platform as of January 2021.

Another option to buy IRISnet coins is [Hotbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotbit/), which has already processed trade volumes to the amount of $148,196 as of January 2021

Stratis,STRAX,stratis,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1343.png,coin,"What Is Stratis (STRAX)?
------------------------

Stratis is a blockchain-as-a-service platform that offers several products and services for enterprises, including launching private sidechains, running full nodes, developing and deploying [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), an initial coin offering platform, and a proof-of-identity application. The company also provides [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) wallets and [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) consulting services.

Stratis operates its own blockchain powered by a native token, STRAX, used to purchase and operate services such as executing smart contracts, paying for sidechains, and [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) as collateral to operate a Masternode --- a node on the network that provides a specific needed service.

The platform was first [announced](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1512202.0) in June 2016, and it [launched](https://twitter.com/stratisplatform/status/762773889546129409) in August 2016. In November 2020, Stratis [deployed](https://twitter.com/stratisplatform/status/1327045046378651649) a new blockchain that uses STRAX instead of its previous STRAT token.

## Who Are the Founders of Stratis?

Stratis Group Ltd., the company behind the Stratis platform, was founded in 2016 by Chris Trew. He started the company with the purpose of developing an enterprise-focused blockchain platform, which he [felt](https://aithority.com/interviews/ait-megamind/aithority-interview-with-chris-trew-ceo-at-stratis-group/) was missing from the industry at the time. He decided to base the platform on the [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) protocol, believing that Bitcoin would become dominant in the crypto space --- meaning that its codebase would be consistently improved over time.

Before starting Stratis, Trew's background was in enterprise information technology. He [taught](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspDl0qTUjk) himself the programming language C# and spent 10 years serving in various IT roles in the legal, aviation and public sectors as well as with financial institutions such as Barclays. He also [operated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BS50vABJnI) an internet marketing and search engine optimization business.

Within the crypto and blockchain industry, Trew [was](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/news/meet-chris-trew-at-csharpcon18-keynote) a volunteer developer for the cryptocurrency project Blitz and social networking platform The Viral Exchange.

## What Makes Stratis Unique?

According to its [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper), the Stratis BaaS platform is [designed](https://www.stratisplatform.com/files/Stratis_Whitepaper.pdf) for financial service providers and other enterprises to test, develop and deploy blockchain-based applications in a way that avoids the overhead and security concerns of operating their own networks. To do so, Stratis offers businesses the opportunity to run permissioned, private sidechains that interact with its primary chain, as well as to host [decentralized applications](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps), launch smart contracts and utilize various privacy and identity verification tools. Its whitepaper argues that this approach gives enterprises the freedom to completely customize their platforms without the limitations of relying on a major blockchain, such as Bitcoin or [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) (ETH).

Stratis has announced business partnerships with companies such as software giant [Microsoft](https://www.stratisplatform.com/2018/10/24/19803-2/), technology markets intelligence firm [International Data Corporation](https://www.stratisplatform.com/2019/07/11/stratis-monthly-5/), and pharmaceutical blockchain development company [MediConnect](https://www.stratisplatform.com/2018/12/19/stratis-partnership-with-mediconnect/), among [others](https://www.stratisplatform.com/2017/03/03/stratis-group-partners-with-escalate-group/). In addition, it has [sponsored](https://www.stratisplatform.com/2019/03/07/stratis-monthly-1/) professional athletes as a way to raise awareness of the platform.

With the launch of its new STRAX-based blockchain in November 2020, Stratis [unveiled](https://www.stratisplatform.com/2020/11/26/stratis-development-roadmap/) an updated development roadmap for the end of 2020 and the first half of 2021. It includes interoperability with Ethereum, an Internet of Things software development kit, a [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) software library, the launch of a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao), and more.

## How Many Stratis (STRAX) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Stratis launched its first STRAT token with a total supply of 98 million, with 84 million STRAT (85.7%) [sold](https://web.archive.org/web/20160727190959/https://stratisplatform.com/2016/06/14/ico-terms/) during an [initial coin offering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) that ended in July 2016 and [raised](https://twitter.com/stratisplatform/status/762769022035386369) 915 BTC --- [worth](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/?start=20160725&end=20160726) nearly $600,000 at the time. Of the remaining supply, 8 million STRAT (8.2%) was reserved for the Stratis team, 2 million STRAT (2%) for advisors and partners, and 4 million STRAT (4.1%) for bounties and campaigns.

In October 2020, Stratis [initiated](https://www.stratisplatform.com/2020/10/15/strax-token-swap/) a token swap process for STRAT holders to exchange their tokens for STRAX at a one-to-one ratio. As a part of the transition, 25 million STRAX was newly minted, of which 8.125 million STRAX was [reserved](https://www.stratisplatform.com/2020/09/25/introducing-strax/) for the Stratis Foundation, 6.375 million STRAX for network incentivization, 5.5 million STRAX for enterprise incentivization, and 5 million for the Stratis DAO. The tokens will be issued over the course of five years.

New STRAX is introduced through a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) mining process, and each block produces a block reward of 18 STRAX, putting its annual inflation rate at around 10%. Half of the block reward is awarded to the block producer, while the other half is sent to its Cirrus sidechain and distributed to block-producing masternodes.

## How Is the Stratis Network Secured?

The Stratis network is secured through its PoS [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) protocol in which nodes must stake STRAX to participate in the block validation process, and the more STRAX staked, the greater the chance of being able to create a block. According to Stratis, this [makes](https://academy.stratisplatform.com/Architecture%20Reference/FullNode/PoS/PoS-introduction.html) the network more secure because the more STRAX a user stakes, the less likely they are to want to manipulate the network, as they risk losing their stake or causing the value of their stake to plummet. A majority of nodes must agree that a transaction is accurate for it to be added to the blockchain.

With the launch of its STRAX-based blockchain in November 2020, Stratis announced new security-enhancing features, including the ability to ""cold-stake"" --- stake STRAX through an offline, cold wallet --- which it argued will increase network security by enabling more users to participate in the consensus process. It also reported that it would activate Segregated Witness, or SegWit, which will increase transaction security because transaction IDs are no longer malleable.

While Stratis is a private company, its blockchain's codebase is open source, meaning that it is [available](https://github.com/stratisproject) for community audit.

## Where Can You Buy Stratis (STRAX)?

STRAX can be purchased on exchanges such as [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Upbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/upbit/) and [Bithumb](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bithumb/).

PAX Gold,PAXG,pax-gold,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/4705.png,token,"## What Is Pax Gold (PAXG)?

Pax Gold (PAXG) is a gold-backed cryptocurrency, launched by the creators of Paxos Standard (PAX) in September 2019. As an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token operating on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain), Pax Gold is tradeable on a large variety of exchanges and has become an accessible way for traders to start investing in gold. 

The main goal behind Pax Gold is to make gold more tradable, as the physical commodity is not easily divisible or flexible in terms of transport. This is why [Paxos Standard](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/paxos-standard/) decided to create a cryptocurrency entirely backed by gold. According to the [official whitepaper](https://www.paxos.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PAX-Gold-Whitepaper.pdf), Pax Gold was created to allow investors to buy indefinitely small amounts of gold through the cryptocurrency, thus virtually eliminating minimum buy limits for the commodity. 


### Who Are the Founders of Pax Gold?

[Charles Cascarilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlescascarilla/) is the founder and chief executive officer of both Paxos Standard and Pax Gold. Cascarilla has an extensive career in capital management, which is what led him to explore the vast possibilities cryptocurrencies offer. 

After acquiring a degree in finance from the University of Notre Dame, he co-founded Cedar Hill Capital Partners in 2005. This was the start of his career in finance and capital management. Since 2005, Mr. Cascarilla has participated in several traditional and blockchain-based venture capital projects. 


#### What Makes Pax Gold Unique?

With a growing number of ERC-20 tokens available for purchase, Pax Gold stands out because it is backed by an already established commodity. One of the main goals for Pax Gold is to make investing in gold more accessible. 

The official whitepaper states that “more than USD 3.5 trillion of the total gold available today is used solely for investment purposes;” however, a large portion of it is unavailable to small-time investors. This is where Pax Gold comes into play. Each PAXG token is backed by a fraction of a piece of [London Good Delivery](http://www.lbma.org.uk/good-delivery) gold bar, stored in Brink’s gold vaults, which is the approved storage company by the London Bullion Market Association.

Through combining the security and liquidity offered by blockchain-based cryptocurrency, and the established name of gold as a physical commodity, Pax Gold brings a new investment opportunity to traders. PAXG has inspired other cryptocurrency developers to create gold-backed tokens as well.

Have a look at the [CoinMarketCap blog](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/categories/blog).


#### How Many Pax Gold (PAXG) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Pax Gold tokens have a one to one ratio with the gold storage backing it. This means that there is a PAXG coin for each ounce of gold in rotation covered by the Pax Gold protocol. In this sense, the amount of PAXG tokens in circulation changes frequently. 

At the moment of writing, there are about 60,161 PAXG coins in circulation. However, the number of coins shifts almost by the minute as new investors are introduced, and Pax Gold increases the available gold supply for backing. 


### How Is the Pax Gold Network Secured?

In the official whitepaper, Pax Gold CEO Charles Cascarilla explains that the PAXG protocol is created entirely on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain and is secured by the proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) model. However, PAXG is not exclusively tied to Ethereum and can be launched on other blockchains as well.

Proof-of-work protocols represent a classic approach to cryptocurrency mining, [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) being the most prominent example. Ethereum has, however, recently begun its transition to the proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) model, aiming to reduce the resources necessary for token mining, among other things.


### Where Can You Buy Pax Gold (PAXG)?

Pax Gold is an ERC-20 token, which means it can be bought on many established exchanges and can be stored in a wide variety of cryptocurrency wallets. 
Some of the top recommended exchanges for trading Pax Gold are [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [BitZ](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitz/) and [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/).
It is important to note that while Pax Gold is backed by physical gold bars, there still is risk associated with investing and trading PAXG.

$DOGE2.0 is not just your average meme token; it's designed to offer a fair and transparent experience to its holders. The creators behind $DOGE2.0 understand the importance of trust, and they have implemented key features to ensure the community's peace of mind.

First and foremost, $DOGE2.0 follows a 1/1 tax mechanism. This means that for every transaction, a fixed percentage is allocated to holders, giving them the opportunity to earn passive income simply by holding $DOGE2.0 in their wallets. This unique feature allows investors to benefit from the token's success while actively contributing to the growth of the community.

But that's not all! The $DOGE2.0 team has gone the extra mile to guarantee the token's safety and longevity. The liquidity has been burned, ensuring that it's locked away forever, creating a scarcity that can drive value appreciation. Additionally, the contract has been renounced, meaning that the developers no longer have any control over the token. This decentralization ensures that $DOGE2.0 remains in the hands of the community, fostering trust and eliminating any possibility of rug pulls or manipulation.

Doge 2.0 ($DOGE2.0) is not just another copycat token; it's a fresh opportunity for redemption. So, whether you're a seasoned crypto investor looking to diversify your portfolio or someone who missed out on the original Doge hype, $DOGE2.0 invites you to be part of a vibrant community with limitless potential.

Uniqly,UNIQ,uniqly,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9287.png,token,"## What Is Uniqly (UNIQ)?

[Uniqly](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniqly/) (UNIQ) is a marketplace and [escrow](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/escrow) for [non-fungible tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) (NFTs), with the possibility of materializing them in the real world. Uniqly does this by enabling users to design their own unique items of clothing, such as hoodies and t-shirts, and mint them as an NFT. Uniqly and its partner companies manufacture and ship the clothing, which can be created by influencers, celebrities, or just people. Each product that is created on the platform is associated with an NFT that represents its real-world value. The clothing is imprinted with QR codes that link to each item’s NFT, providing indisputable proof of its authenticity and owner. Uniqly views the global apparel market as its target, as its solution can be a useful way for clothing brands to combat the circulation of counterfeit items. 


## Who Are the Founders of Uniqly?

[Uniqly](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniqly/) (UNIQ) was founded by Krzysztof Perdek, a Polish entrepreneur with five years of experience in strategy, partnerships and innovation in financial services, [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) and other technologies. He is supported by Mateusz Bosek, chief technical officer (CTO) and co-founder, who has more than nine years of experience in creating startups, enterprise environments and building large-scale applications in the fintech industry for banks like HSBC. Other key members include Mateusz Kara, chief legal officer (CLO), who has expertise in [cryptocurrencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) and fintech, and Hubert Dolata, head of marketing.


## What Makes Uniqly Unique?

[Uniqly](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniqly/) (UNIQ)’s key product is its item generator, a multi-functional tool for creating original clothing and accessory designs. With the generator, users can create unique apparel, ranging from t-shirts and sweatshirts to hats and masks. For instance, if an influencer wanted to create their own line of clothing, they could do so with the generator and the design would then be manufactured by one of Uniqly’s partner companies. Fans could then purchase the NFT that is attached to the clothing. On Uniqly, when a user wants to physically receive a real-world item, the corresponding NFT is [burned](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary?term=burn) so that the token cannot be reused.

Uniqly also offers an escrow service, through which users can send clothing to Uniqly as a trusted third party and receive an NFT in exchange that can then be traded or leveraged for financial use on its NFTfi platform.

Dogecoin,DOGE,dogecoin,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/74.png,coin,"## What Is Dogecoin?
Dogecoin (DOGE) is based on the popular ""doge"" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. The open-source digital currency was [created by](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/dogecoin-a-stunning-surge-a-crushing-blow-a-surprise-comeback) Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia, and was forked from Litecoin in December 2013. Dogecoin's creators envisaged it as a fun, light-hearted cryptocurrency that would have greater appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience, since it was based on a dog meme. Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted several tweets on social media that Dogecoin is his favorite coin.
 
### How Do You Mine Dogecoin?
Dogecoin differs from Bitcoin's proof-of-work protocol in several ways, one of which is by using Scrypt technology. The altcoin has also a block time of 1 minute, and the total supply is uncapped, which means that there is no limit to the number of Dogecoin that can be mined.
You can [mine Dogecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mine-dogecoin) either solo, or by joining a mining pool. A Doge miner can mine the digital currency on Windows, Mac or Linux, and with a GPU. As of 2014, you can also mine Litecoin in the same process of mining Dogecoin, as the processes were merged.
 
### What Can Dogecoin Be Used For?
Dogecoin has been used primarily as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter to reward the creation or sharing of quality content. You can get tipped Dogecoin by participating in a community that uses the digital currency, or you can get your Dogecoin from a Dogecoin faucet. A Dogecoin faucet is a website that will give you a small amount of Dogecoin for free as an introduction to the currency, so that you can begin interacting in Dogecoin communities.
 
### How Can You Buy Dogecoin?
You can sell or [buy Dogecoin](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Dogecoin-Doge) at any exchange that offers the digital currency, store it on an exchange or in a Dogecoin wallet, and tip Dogecoin in any communities that accept Dogecoin.  For the latest list of exchanges and trading pairs for this cryptocurrency, click on our [market pairs tab](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/).

### Elon Musk and Dogecoin

The success of Dogecoin is closely intertwined with Elon Musk's passion for it. Musk began tweeting about Dogecoin in early 2021, sharing a [Lion King DOGE meme](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/elon-musk-shares-surreal-lion-king-picture-and-calls-dogecoin-the-peoples-crypto). That kickstarted a furious DOGE rally — [with temporary dips](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/did-a-single-elon-musk-tweet-cause-dogecoin-to-tumble-by-23) — that culminated in [Musk's appearance on Saturday Night Live](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/elon-musk-hints-dogecoin-will-moon-when-he-hosts-saturday-night-live). 

After the SNL appearance, [DOGE crashed](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/dogecoin-price-crashes-after-elon-musks-awkward-saturday-night-live-appearance) despite [Musk's promises to moon its price](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/elon-musk-hints-dogecoin-will-moon-when-he-hosts-saturday-night-live). In the following months, Musk seemed to lose interest, and the price of DOGE has tumbled over 70% from its all-time high. However, Musk still wields power over Dogecoin, as [occasional tweets ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/elon-gets-doge-fever-again)indicate.


## Dogecoin Foundation and Board of Advisors

In 2014, a not-for-profit foundation was formed by members of the Dogecoin team to provide support, advocacy, trademark protection and governance for the cryptocurrency project. However, the foundation was dissolved over time.

After several years of being inactive, the foundation was relaunched in 2021 with a “renewed focus on supporting the Dogecoin Ecosystem, community and promoting the future of the Dogecoin Blockchain.” In addition to some of the original core team, the project now has some seasoned industry players as part of its board of advisors.

According to[ the foundation’s website](https://foundation.dogecoin.com/about/), members of the board will meet monthly to discuss issues relating to Dogecoin.

In regards to its advisors, the group is made up of Dogecoin founder Billy Markus, the project’s core developer Max Keller, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk as represented by the head of the Musk’s family office, Jared Birchall.

Members of the Board of Advisors will function in various capacities. While Keller will serve as the project’s technical advisor, Markus will be in charge of the community and memes. Meanwhile, Buterin will function as the blockchain and crypto advisor for the foundation, and Birchall will represent Elon Musk as legal and financial advisor.

As a first assignment, the Board of Advisors will be working to secure three-year funding that would allow it to employ a small, dedicated staff to work on Dogecoin full-time. Up until now, the work on the ecosystem has been done by volunteers.

## What Is Dogecoin’s Libdogecoin?

Weeks after the release of Dogecoin Core version 1.14.6, core developer Michi Lumin announced the launch of Libdogecoin, a C-library of the network’s building blocks.

Libdogecoin would allow developers to build Dogecoin-compliant products “without needing to worry about the deeper specifics of the crypto functions.” This means that less technical members can easily design products that comply with Dogecoin standards.

Since the update is a pure library, it will not provide a “runnable” node facility. However, Libdogecoin will support multiple languages, including Python, Node.js and Ruby.


### Companies That Accept Dogecoin

Due to its low transaction fees and constant patronage from Elon Musk, a number of traditional companies have moved to make Dogecoin a payment option.

Here’s a list of some companies that currently accept Dogecoin payments:



* Tesla
* AMC Theaters
* GameStop
* airBaltic
* Dallas Mavericks
* EasyDNS
* Newegg
* Twitch.

Established in July 2017 in Singapore, Telcoin leverages blockchain technology to provide access to decentralized financial services on any mobile device. The company’s launch product, Telcoin Remittances, is focused on high-speed, low-cost digital money transfers to mobile money platforms and e-wallets. Telcoin Remittances connect with telecom, mobile money, and e-wallet partners globally to make sending money convenient, affordable, and secure.

Telcoin recently launched Version 3 of the platform, which introduced two user-owned financial products including The Send Money Smarter Network (SMS) a user-owned, global remittance network and TELxchange, a user-owned, decentralized digital asset exchange.

How Many Telcoin (TEL) Tokens Are There in Circulation?
Telcoin is built on the Ethereum blockchain. At its launch in 2017, 25 percent of the tokens were distributed in crowdsale to investors. Another 15 percent were retained by the Telcoin Team, with a 5 percent liquidity fund.

The maximum number of tokens on the network are fixed at 100,000,000,000 TEL. Currently, approximately 50 percent of the tokens (50,270,110,195 TEL) have been issued.

How Is Telcoin Secured?
Telcoin is an ERC-20 token native to Ethereum, one of the most secure computing networks in the world. Via the Telcoin Mobile Application, TEL users can securely store and transact their assets using a 2 for 3 multi-signature ethereum wallet and never have to worry about secure generation and store of alpha-numeric private keys or 12 to 24 word secret phrases.

Where Can You Buy the Telcoin (TEL)?
Although TEL is a very popular crypto asset, few exchanges provide the facility to purchase TEL tokens against fiat. You can buy TEL tokens against cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

The top exchanges for buying, selling, and trading in Telcoin (TEL) currently are:

KuCoin

Uniswap

Tezos,XTZ,tezos,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2011.png,coin,"## What Is Tezos (XTZ)?

Tezos is a blockchain network that’s based on smart contracts, in a way that’s not too dissimilar to Ethereum. However, there’s a big difference: Tezos aims to offer infrastructure that is more advanced — meaning it can evolve and improve over time without there ever being a danger of a hard fork. This is something that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have suffered since they were created. People who hold XTZ can vote on proposals for protocol upgrades that have been put forward by Tezos developers.

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Tezos](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-tezos).

This open-source platform bills itself as “secure, upgradable and built to last” — and says its smart contract language provides the accuracy that is required for high-value use cases. According to Tezos, its approach means that it is futureproof and will “remain state-of-the-art long into the future,” meaning it can embrace developments in blockchain technology.

The technology underpinning Tezos was first proposed in a white paper that was released in September 2014. After a series of delays, the Tezos mainnet launched four years later.

## Who Are the Founders of Tezos?

Arthur Breitman was the man who wrote the Tezos white paper — and in a nod to [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto), he wrote his works under the pen name L. M. Goodman. He argued that one of Bitcoin’s biggest failings was the lack of a governance process that invited contributions from the community who use the network — as well as the fact that new tokens couldn’t be issued through this blockchain.

He and his wife Kathleen founded a startup called Dynamic Ledger Solutions which was tasked with writing the code that would underpin the Tezos protocol. This company was subsequently purchased by the Tezos Foundation to ensure that it owned all of the intellectual property rights relating to the network.

### What Makes Tezos Unique?

Although staking is common across blockchains, Tezos has a unique twist on this process. Participants can get involved with the network’s governance through “baking,” where they effectively stake 8,000 XTZ. This creates a financial incentive to act honestly.

Bakers are then tasked with voting on proposed changes to the blockchain’s code in a four-step procedure that takes approximately 23 days. Proposals that receive support from the vast majority of participants are put through their paces on a testnet for 48 hours and are fully implemented if they are backed by a super-majority.

Tezos is also unique because of how it has started to be used by high-profile businesses. In September 2020, it was announced that the French banking giant Societe Generale planned to use this blockchain for experimenting with a central bank digital currency.

Big cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase have also unveiled support for Tezos staking, meaning users can receive rewards based on the XTZ that they hold. This is not a feature that’s seen too widely across digital assets.

[A Deep Dive Into Tezos](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-tezos)


### How Many Tezos (XTZ) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Our data shows that 743,862,304 XTZ are in circulation at the time of writing.

A token sale for Tezos was held back in July 2017 — and during this ICO, a total of 65,681 BTC and 361,122 ETH was raised. At the time, this was worth $232 million, securing its place as one of the largest initial coin offerings ever held.

While 80% of this initial supply went to investors, 20% was split equally between the Tezos Foundation and Dynamic Ledger Solutions.

The mainnet’s launch was delayed by a series of lawsuits from some disgruntled investors, who argued that XTZ amounted to unregistered securities.

### How Is the Tezos Network Secured?

Like other blockchains, Tezos uses a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) consensus mechanism.

Anyone can become a validator and contribute to the smooth running of the network by making a security deposit. To incentivize honest behavior, rewards are given to those who work in the best interests of the blockchain — and those who act dishonestly risk losing their stake altogether.

### Where Can You Buy Tezos (XTZ)?

XTZ, otherwise known as “tez” for short, can be purchased from most major exchanges — including Binance, Coinbase and others. Trading pairs unite XTZ with fiat currencies, as well as other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.[ If you’re looking to convert fiat into Bitcoin, you can read a comprehensive guide here.](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/)

### About Tezos Nodes

Mdex,MDX,mdex,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/8335.png,token,"## What Is Mdex (MDX)?

[MDEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mdex) is a new decentralized trading protocol that launched in January 2021.

MDEX is an automated market making ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)) decentralized exchange protocol that operates on the concept of fund pools, sharing some similarities with standard DEXs, but differentiating itself from competitors by using a dual-chain model modeled on both the Ethereum network and the [Huobi Ecological Chain (HECO)](https://www.hecochain.com/en-us/), which gives it access to the liquidity of the Ethereum ecosystem.

A trading platform built [on top of](https://medium.com/coinmonks/company-watch-mdex-on-huobi-eco-chain-12b9efa421af) HECO, MDEX has an estimated cost for token swaps at $0.001 for each trade, with a transaction speed of three seconds.


#### What Makes Mdex Unique?

The vast majority of DeFi projects live on the Ethereum network as [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) assets, but it is facing problems with expensive [gas](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas) fees and slow transaction speeds during its transition to Ethereum 2.0.

Most newly-developed protocols heavily consider scalability factors in their choice of blockchain networks if they want a fast adoption rate. Uniswap at least had an early-mover advantage, since it launched before the Ethereum network became heavily congested  — and some say that Uniswap itself is one of the main reasons for the network’s congestion, However, Uniswap’s market majority could change really fast if second-layer solutions are not rolled out in time and deliver their expected results.

For this reason, the Huobi Ecological Chain-based Mdex claims a unique characteristic of being based on a chain that aims to avoid scalability problems.

### How Is the Mdex Network Secured?

[Huobi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), the Seychelles-based crypto exchange founded in China and listed in Hong Kong, is a cryptocurrency trading platform. Huobi officially launched its eco-chain HECO in December 2020: the new platform claims to have a maximum 500 [transactions-per-second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactions_per_second) (TPS) rate, transaction confirmation time of three seconds and a gas fee of $0.001.


#### MDEX’s Dual Mining Innovation

There are instances where transactions made on MDEX can cost almost nothing, sometimes resulting in even negative charges, since users are given rewards for trading and mining, effectively canceling out the costs of transacting on the [network](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/network).


#### MDEX’s Deflationary Tokenomics Keeps MDX Sustainable

MDEX’s [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics) follows a [“repurchase and burn”](https://mdex.medium.com/mdex-economic-whitepaper-1bdc882e20c9) model, which decreases the [circulating supply](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/circulating-supply) of the MDX token over time, driving up its value. This model keeps the value of MDX sustainable over the long run. Its tokenomics are also further supported by the “repurchase and reward” model, which further incentivizes MDX holders to keep their tokens.

On top of yield rewards, MDX tokens can also be used to participate in the governance mechanism of one of the fastest-growing DEXs in the market. Holders can propose and vote on the listing of a token on the MDEX market or collateralization of any other asset.


#### MDEX’s Protocol Compatibility Brings Project Partnerships

MDEX is designed for users and project developers as it implements an [automated market maker (AMM)](https://medium.com/mdex-official/challenge-uniswaps-dex-leadership-a-comparison-of-mdex-and-uniswap-c1d55fa4ad25) that facilitates low [slippages](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage) for trades, good market depth and high yields for transaction and liquidity miners.

[Huobi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) and HECO-based projects also use the deployment of MDEX as it facilitates the trade of these networks’ supported assets. [Ethereum-based DeFi](https://onlineprnews.com/news/50005248-1614324539-mdex-dual-mining-achieves-zero-transaction-fees-overtakes-uniswaps-daily-trading-volume.html/) protocols such as [AAVE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/), [BAL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/balancer/), [LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/) and [YFI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/) have also begun liquidity mining on MDEX.

Lisk,LSK,lisk,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1214.png,coin,"## What Is Lisk (LSK)?

[Lisk](https://lisk.com) is striving to on-board 100,000,000 users into crypto and web3 by offering an accessible blockchain application platform and an industry leading JavaScript SDK.

Released in 2019, the Lisk SDK enables developers to build application-specific blockchains entirely in JavaScript, the most widely used programming language in the world. To get a deep-dive into the Lisk SDK, please visit the [Lisk SDK documentation](https://lisk.com/documentation/lisk-sdk/index.html) or watch [Lisk.js 2019](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLixm1arf_lEy1IK3AQiKK_J0hdO9rGc30) and [Lisk.js 2022](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLixm1arf_lExhMdtyoH5Ku9wuUKWTL_v6).

To be released in 2022, the Lisk blockchain application platform allows interoperability between all application-specific blockchains built with the Lisk SDK. With other words, users will be able to use DeFi, NFT or Metaverse blockchain applications on Lisk.

To better understand why Lisk is important watch the following videos: [The Case for Lisk](https://youtu.be/tpsHK2T-F8c) and [The Ultimate Vision for Lisk](https://youtu.be/Z29ikkzzvlo).

If you are curious about Lisk’s history and journey, watch [Looking Back on Lisk](https://youtu.be/qt3cuNjw2Yo).

The Lisk project is managed by the Lisk Foundation, a non-profit entity based in Zug, Switzerland. A local team of experts specialized in law and finance, as well as yearly audits, ensure the proper handling of funds and regulatory compliance under the supervision of the Swiss Federal Foundation Supervisory Authority (ESA, Eidgenössische Stiftungsaufsicht).  

The Lisk products are developed by the Lightcurve GmbH, a Berlin based blockchain studio. With a team of over 40 blockchain experts, Lightcurve is researching, developing and promoting the Lisk SDK and the Lisk blockchain application platform.


## What Makes Lisk Unique?

### Accessibility

Accessibility is part of the Lisk vision. Lisk believes that not only technical people or the elite should have access to crypto and web3, but everyone in the world. This vision flows through everything Lisk is doing and into their products.

### Proven & established

Founded in 2016, Lisk is one of the oldest crypto projects in existence. The team has proven to diligently and consistently work on the project with one of the [highest development activity](https://cryptomode.com/top-4-crypto-projects-ranked-by-90-day-developer-activity/) in the industry and [high funding](https://lisk.com/blog/tags/financial-update) to last for many years ahead.

### Application-specific chains

Instead of relying on smart contracts, developers are implementing their blockchain applications natively on their own blockchain with the Lisk SDK. This prevents scalability issues and high fees, however maintains composability thanks to interoperability.

### JavaScript

Instead of using archaic and niche or new and unproven programming languages, the Lisk SDK is fully written in JavaScript tapping into the biggest pool of developers globally.


## How Is the Lisk Network Secured?

Lisk is secured through an environmentally friendly and highly efficient [Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm](https://lisk.com/blog/research/3-new-dpos-lips-changing-voting-system-lisk) and finality guaranteeing [BFT protocol](https://lisk.com/blog/research/introducing-byzantine-fault-tolerance-consensus-lisk). Without the need for miners the electricity consumption of the entire network is kept to a minimum while ensuring high-throughput and security.

Industry-leading [development standards and test coverage](http://github.com/LiskHQ/) at Lisk ensures smooth operation since the launch of the network on May 24th, 2016. [Regular third party security audits](https://lisk.com/blog/development/external-security-audit-lisk-sdk-5.0.0-and-lisk-core-3.0.0) bring further trust and reputation.

## How Many Lisk (LSK) Coins Are There in Circulation?

In 2016 at the time of the [Lisk ICO](https://lisk.com/blog/announcement/lisk-ico-terms) the Lisk blockchain started with 100,000,000 LSK at a market value of $5,800,000. Approximately 6 years later, in February 2022, there are around 140,000,000 LSK available at a market value of $240,000,000. This represents an over 40x return, given the LSK token price now.

At launch, only 8% of the initial LSK token supply went to the Lisk co-founders, which is at the lower end of today’s standards.

Today, the annual inflation rate of the LSK token is only about 2% which is one of the industry’s lowest rates.


## Who Are the Founders of Lisk?

Lisk was founded by Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows.

[Max Kordek](https://twitter.com/maxkordek) is the CEO of Lisk and a globally recognized crypto entrepreneur. At just 24 years old, Max co-founded Lisk and raised over 14,000 BTC during its ICO in 2016 and within the same year co-founded Lightcurve, a leading blockchain studio based in Berlin. Since then, Max has become increasingly involved in the global crypto community, speaking at many of the top blockchain conferences in the world. Today, he is working relentlessly to help the industry gain traction.

Gala,GALA,gala,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/7080.png,token,"## What is Gala Games?

[Gala Games](https://gala.games/) was created by industry-leading game developers who came together to bring value back to the players with the help of Web3 and blockchain tech. Its founders saw major problems with the way today’s leading game publishers demand that players continually spend to keep enjoying a game they love. Scrapping the old model, Gala is creating a huge platform with AAA-level games (many free to play) designed to give players more freedom, control, and rewards than ever.

With dozens of Web3 games (including many well-known IPs) in various stages of development or already released, Gala Games is poised to become a Web3 gaming ecosystem large enough to compete with mainstream platforms.

## What is GALA?

GALA is the core utility token for Gala Games. It is the main token with which NFT items can be purchased, it is the reward received by [Founder’s Node](https://support.gala.games/posts/4612477-founder-s-node) operators for operating their Nodes, and it is the Gas token used to cover network fees on Gala’s blockchain.

Each day, 50% of GALA emission is distributed to Founder’s Node operators, and 50% is distributed to the Gala Games conservatorship, where it is reserved for future ecosystem growth and/or project funding.

Total daily emission of GALA is halved each year on July 21st, according to the following schedule:

From 7/21/21 to 7/21/22 - 17,123,286 GALA per day
From 7/21/22 to 7/21/23 - 8,561,643 GALA per day
From 7/21/23 to 7/21/24 - 4,280,822 GALA per day

More about GALA tokenomics can be found [in this support article](https://support.gala.games/posts/4612514-gala-tokenomics).

## Who are the Founders of Gala Games?

Gala Games was founded in 2019 by Eric Schiermeyer, Co-founder of Zynga, along with like-minded experts from gaming, crypto pioneers and blockchain developers. Success in mobile gaming with titles like Zynga Poker, Farmville and Mafia Wars set the stage for a huge leap toward player empowerment.

Including the teams at [Gala Music](https://music.gala.com/) and [Gala Film](https://film.gala.com/), as of early 2023 there are approximately 400 people around the world working for the fully remote US-based company.

## What Makes Gala Games Unique?

Centuries of combined experience from some of the greatest game devs makes Gala Games truly unique in both the Web3 and gaming worlds. They are committed to a “games-first” approach, always reaching for the greatest possible gaming experience above all else.

The team at Gala Games is passionate about gaming. They are taking the most cutting edge aspects of Web3 tech, and using them to give gamers freedom like they have never seen: Freedom to own, freedom to earn, and freedom to play.

Gala Games also aims to simplify the onboarding process for gamers entering the Web3 world, allowing users to begin making blockchain transactions by simply connecting an existing Coinbase or MetaMask wallet. Additionally, many Gala Games items can be purchased directly with credit cards.

Gala Games works closely with OpenSea to facilitate its official NFT collections, which can all be found on [this collection page](https://opensea.io/category/galagames). Because every Gala account has a corresponding Ethereum wallet, players are able to easily trade their items peer-to-peer on OpenSea.

The Gala Games team is very accessible in the [Discord community](https://galagames.chat/), where players and community members are truly listened to. This open dialogue community approach has been one of the greatest secrets to Gala’s success.

In early 2022, Gala Games expanded its mission to encompass all of Web3 entertainment, launching both Gala Music and Gala Film. Additionally, Gala’s generative NFT avatar project, [VOX](https://collectvox.com/), has dropped 4 successful series, including collaborations with Dreamworks’ Trolls and AMC’s The Walking Dead. An ambitious and gamified metaverse home for all VOX is currently being developed by Will Wright, creator of The Sims.

Gala users collect in-game NFTs from different games on the platform. They can either use them in-game for various benefits, boosts and reward opportunities, or trade them as they please on the secondary market. This ability to own and trade in-game items allows players to shop and play with less commitment, giving them the freedom to play more games.

While Gala often develops its own games (Town Star, Mirandus, Last Expedition, The Walking Dead: Empires), the company also works with award-winning external gaming studios. A list of currently playable or in-development Gala Games can be found [on this page](https://games.gala.com/games).

In late 2022, Gala Games unveiled its own “games-first” layer-1 blockchain solution (currently called Project GYRI). Assets on Gala’s blockchain are fully bridgeable to and from the Ethereum blockchain, and GALA acts as the gas token for all transactions. When GALA is collected as transactional fees, a portion is burned, and a portion is distributed to Founder’s Node operators as an additional reward.

Throughout 2023 and beyond, Gala has many announcements and releases planned as the Gala Games platform takes shape as the world leader of Web3 gaming.

## How Many GALA Coins are in Circulation?

The maximum total supply will be approximately 50 billion GALA.

Each day, 50% of GALA emission is distributed to Founder’s Node operators, and 50% is distributed to the Gala Games conservatorship, where it is reserved for future ecosystem growth and/or project funding.

When GALA is spent on NFTs in the Gala Games store, 100% of that GALA is burned. Then, an equal amount of GALA is added to the lifetime distribution pool to eventually be recirculated as described above.

Total daily emission of GALA is halved each year on July 21st, according to the following schedule:

From 7/21/21 to 7/21/22 - 17,123,286 GALA per day
From 7/21/22 to 7/21/23 - 8,561,643 GALA per day
From 7/21/23 to 7/21/24 - 4,280,822 GALA per day
…continuing in this pattern

Neo,NEO,neo,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1376.png,coin,"## What Is Neo (NEO)?

** **

Neo bills itself as a “rapidly growing and developing” ecosystem that has the goal of becoming the foundation for the next generation of the internet — a new economy where digitized payments, identities and assets come together.

 

Initially known as Antshares, this project was believed to be China’s first-ever public blockchain when it was launched in February 2014. The open-source platform subsequently rebranded to Neo three years later.

 

As well as creating a worldwide community of developers who create new infrastructure for the network and lower barriers to entry, the team behind this project operate an EcoBoost initiative that’s designed to encourage people to build decentralized apps and smart contracts on its blockchain.

 

It’s often been likened to the Chinese version of the Ethereum network.


## Who Are the Founders of Neo?

** **

The co-founders of Neo, and its predecessor Antshares, are Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang. Both serve as chairmen of the Neo Foundation, which aims to promote the blockchain’s adoption.

 

Da Hongfei has said that, although the internet is a great invention, it has many flaws — and this means that everyday consumers don’t always have control over their own data. The entrepreneur believes blockchain applications will eventually go mainstream.

 

Erik Zhang was the author of the Delegated [Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft) algorithm, which aims to deter untrustworthy participants from taking part in the blockchain’s operation. This technology went on to be used in the Neo blockchain. He also served as the core developer for this network, and is playing an instrumental role in the development of Neo 3.0, the next iteration of the project’s infrastructure.


## What Makes Neo Unique?

** **

One of the unique selling points of the Neo blockchain concerns its continuous development, which helps ensure that it is futureproof and able to cope with sudden increases in demand. As mentioned earlier, the project has developed Neo 3.0 — enhancing network security and allowing a greater number of transactions per second to be processed.

 

Unlike many other blockchains, this network also has two native tokens: NEO and GAS. While NEO serves as an investment token and allows people to participate in votes concerning improvements to the blockchain, GAS is used to pay fees for the transactions that are being completed on the network.

 

Few other blockchain projects also run a development fund to the extent that Neo does. EcoBoost launched back in 2019, and it was billed as an initiative that provides “full life-cycle support for high-potential projects” — including grants, technical support and promotion on social media.

### How Many Neo (NEO) Coins Are There in Circulation?

** **

At the time of writing, there are 70.5 million NEO in circulation — and a total supply of 100 million. NEO tokens aren’t mined, and indeed, all 100 million of them were generated when the blockchain launched.

 

These tokens were distributed on a 50/50 basis — with half going to participants in a token sale, and the other half being split among developers and the NEO Council. At the time, it was confirmed that these funds would be used to invest in other blockchain protocol that the organization supports.

 

Meanwhile, GAS is generated every 20 seconds or so, whenever a new block is created. The number of tokens created gradually reduces every year, and it’s estimated that it’ll take 22 years for the total supply of 100 million to enter circulation.


### How Is the Neo Network Secured?

** **

As we mentioned earlier, Neo uses Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance, and it’s estimated that the blockchain is capable of processing thousands of transactions per second.

 

According to Neo, the dBFT mechanism has been inspired by the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm.

 

There are a couple of similarities with delegated proof-of-stake, given how both consensus mechanisms allow token holders to vote for the delegates who will process transactions.

 

Through dBFT, blocks are added to a blockchain as long as at least two-thirds of delegates reach consensus — and it’s hoped that this helps prevent bad actors from undermining the smooth running of the network.


### Where Can You Buy Neo (NEO)?

** **

NEO can be purchased on a number of exchanges — most people [buy NEO](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-NEO) on Binance, Poloniex and HitBTC. But it isn’t available universally and isn’t supported by some platforms, such as Coinbase.

Mazuri GameFi,MZR,mazuri-gamefi,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/24045.png,token,"""Mazuri GameFi is an open-world game and a blockchain-based Fighter Simulator that is partially operated by players. It draws inspiration from popular games such as Absolver, For Honor, and GTA V Online. In Mazuri GameFi, players can fight other players for tokens and NFTs, join guilds, participate in mass PvP, train and customize their Fighters, and level them up to take part in high-reward tournaments. Additionally, players can own in-game assets like Cyber Estate and Vehicles, as well as trade NFTs.

MZR is a deflationary token that goes into a pool when players bet on themselves. After the fight, the winner takes 95% of the pool, and the remaining 5% is partially burned and partially put into staking, treasury, rewards, and marketing allocations. Buying in-game NFTs with MZR results in token burning.

Mazuri GameFi encourages players to take care of their fighters and allows them to rent out their in-game assets. Each asset has a correlated NFT, and MZR is used for governance. The voting system allows players with MZR to have a say in what they want to build, change, or add to the city.""","{""website"":[""https://www.mazuri.io""],""technical_doc"":[""https://mazuri-gamefi.gitbook.io/whitepaper-mazuri-gamefi/""],""explorer"":[""https://etherscan.io/token/0xa98A8a74AA8d6F41f9E498a084548C4db63c8F01""],""source_code"":[],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/mazuri-gamefi""],""chat"":[""https://t.me/mazurigamefi""],""announcement"":[],""reddit"":[],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/MazuriGamefi""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1027.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0xa98A8a74AA8d6F41f9E498a084548C4db63c8F01"",""ContractPlatform"":""Ethereum"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://etherscan.io/token/0xa98A8a74AA8d6F41f9E498a084548C4db63c8F01""}]",[],[]

Aave,AAVE,aave,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/7278.png,token,"## What Is Aave (AAVE)?

** **

Aave is a decentralized finance protocol that allows people to lend and borrow crypto.

 

Lenders earn interest by depositing digital assets into specially created liquidity pools. Borrowers can then use their crypto as collateral to take out a flash loan using this liquidity.

 

Aave (which means “ghost” in Finnish) was originally known as ETHLend when it launched in November 2017, but the rebranding to Aave happened in September 2018. (This helps explain why this token’s ticker is so different from its name!)

 

AAVE provides holders with discounted fees on the platform, and it also serves as a governance token — giving owners a say in the future development of the protocol.


## Who Are the Founders of Aave?

** **

Aave, and its predecessor ETHLend, were founded by Stani Kulechov. At the time, he was frustrated at the lack of lending applications on Ethereum — and his project was built before [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) even existed.

 

Kulechov is a serial entrepreneur who went to law school and began programming when he was a teenager. He was an early adopter in the blockchain space. The CEO has said that he wanted to rebrand ETHLend as Aave so the company could offer a wider range of services beyond Ether lending.

 

According to Kulechov, Aave’s main target market are people who are already engaged in the cryptocurrency community.


## What Makes Aave Unique?

** **

Aave has several unique selling points when compared with competitors in an increasingly crowded market. During the [DeFi craze](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) in the summer of 2020, it was one of the biggest projects in terms of the total value of crypto locked in its protocol.

 

The project allows people to borrow and lend in about 20 cryptocurrencies, meaning that users have a greater amount of choice. One of Aave’s flagship products are “flash loans,” which have been billed as the first uncollateralized loan option in the DeFi space. There’s a catch: they must be paid back within the same transaction.

 

Another big selling point is how those who borrow through Aave can alternate between fixed and variable interest rates. While fixed rates can provide some certainty about costs during times of volatility in the crypto markets, variable rates can come in handy if the borrower thinks that prices will fall in the near future.

### How Many AAVE (AAVE) Coins Are There in Circulation?

** **

Circulation is linked to the total value locked on Aave, as tokens are burned whenever the protocol gathers fees.

 

An [initial coin offering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) was held in November 2017, where $16.2 million was raised by selling one billion AAVE tokens at a rate equivalent to $0.0162 a piece. At the time, 23% of AAVE tokens were assigned to its founders and project.

 

AAVE tokens have been built based on the [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) standard, and they are designed to be deflationary. In the event of a shortfall in the DeFi protocol, staked tokens would be used as collateral as a last resort.

 

In July 2020, Aave unveiled plans to hold a token swap. This means that the 1.3 billion AAVE tokens in circulation would be swapped for the newly minted AAVE cryptocurrency at a ratio of 1:100, creating a total supply of 16 million AAVE. (Three million of this would be held in reserve.)


### How Is the Aave Network Secured?

** **

Aave’s open-source protocol is built on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0), a blockchain that is currently making the transition from [Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake).


### Where Can You Buy Aave (AAVE)?

** **

Some of the biggest exchanges that list AAVE tokens include CoinDCX, Binance, CoinBene and OKEx. You can find out more about[ how to convert fiat into crypto here](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/).

## What Is Sui (SUI)?

Sui is a first-of-its-kind Layer 1 blockchain and smart contract platform designed from the bottom up to make digital asset ownership fast, private, secure, and accessible to everyone. Its object-centric model, based on the Move programming language, enables parallel execution, sub-second finality, and rich on-chain assets. With horizontally scalable processing and storage, Sui supports a wide range of applications with unrivaled speed at low cost. Sui is a step-function advancement in blockchain and a platform on which creators and developers can build amazing, user-friendly experiences.

## Who Are the Founders of Sui?

Mysten Labs, the original contributor to Sui, was founded by by former executives/lead architects of Meta’s Novi Research (the team responsible for Diem blockchain and Move programming language): Evan Cheng; Adeniyi Abiodun; Sam Blackshear; George Danezis; Kostas Chalkias.

## What Makes Sui Unique?

Through features such as horizontal scaling, composability, sparse replay, and on-chain storage, Sui’s architecture solves pain points common to first generation blockchains.

Horizontal Scaling

On the Sui network, each group of transactions process in parallel, as opposed to the bottlenecking that occurs in some earlier blockchains due to any lack of distinction between the various objects, resources, accounts, and other components.

Composability

In Sui, unlike most other blockchains, one can directly pass an asset (such as an NFT), directly into a function argument. Sui’s object-centric approach also allows for more esoteric data structures, and the ability to store assets inside such data structures, or in an asset itself.

Sparse Replay

Naturally, a blockchain provides a ledger of every single transaction. For a Sui-specific example, game builders don’t need to track transactions interacting with unrelated dApps. Because querying on-chain data can be expensive, products on Sui will be able to follow the evolution of the objects in this game, without digging out the data from the Merkle tree.

On-Chain Storage

Because assets are directly stored as objects on the Sui blockchain, they are never subject to Merkle tree indexing. Storing assets directly on-chain is used in tandem with conventional means, such as IPFS, to scale the problem of on-chain storage, as it is much cheaper to directly update assets on-chain.

## How Many Sui (SUI) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Sui is yet to release details about its native SUI token, which is to go live upon the [mainnet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mainnet)launch. It will be used for [gas](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas) fees and to pay for the storage fund. This fund compensates future validators for the costs of previously stored on-chain data. With this upfront-payment model, higher rewards are paid out to validators when the demand for storage is high. 


## How Is the Sui Network Secured?

At launch, Tusk and Narwhal were the default consensus algorithms used by Sui, although Bullshark replaced Tusk as the primary option in August 2022. The move was made to reduce latency issues, and to ensure that validators with lower processing speeds would still be able to contribute to the project. Tusk can still be used via updating the source, however. In short, Narwhal is used as a mempool to ensure that the data submitted to the consensus is available, and Bullshark (or Tusk) then sets the standard for arranging that data so the consensus engine can read it. This is part of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) mempool, which is yet another innovation Sui offers. Coupled with its innovative scaling solution, it will presumably allow the blockchain to reach transaction speeds of over 297,000 [transactions per second](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/transactions-per-second).

## Where Can You Buy Sui (SUI)?

Sui Mainnet will launch on May 3, 2023.

## What is GMX? 

GMX is a decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex)) for trading perpetual cryptocurrency futures with up to 50X leverage on popular cryptocurrencies like [BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and more. The platform launched in September 2021 as Gambit Exchange. To date, GMX has a total trading volume of over $130B and 283K total users, making it the leading derivatives DEX on Arbitrum and Avalanche.

GMX runs on the [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-arbitrum) and the [Avalanche blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-avalanche-a-guide-to-avalanche-s-ecosystem). These ecosystems are connected to the exchange via Synapse — a cross-chain [bridge](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cross-chain-bridges).

## Who Are the Founders of GMX?

The founding team is anonymous, however, the lead developer is likely @xdev_10 on Twitter.


## What Makes GMX Unique?

Instead of an [order book](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/order-book) model employed by centralized exchanges (CEXs), trading occurs via its an innovation to the automated market model (AMM) deployed by DEXs like Uniswap. It features a native multi-asset pool, GLP, which generates revenue for liquidity providers.

GLP operates as a multi-asset [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-liquidity-pool-lp-tokens) ([LP](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-liquidity-pool-lp-tokens)) which comprises of ETH, BTC, LINK, UNI, USDC, USDT, DAI and FRAX at the time of writing. Market prices depend on Chainlink's oracles, which collect token price data from all the top exchanges. 

The decentralized exchange ecosystem is based on two tokens: GLP and GMX. The first token serves to supply liquidity. The GLP price reflects the value of all GMX assets, which are listed for trading with leverage and swaps. In other words, GLP is an index of all assets on the exchange. GMX is the utility and governance token.

Users can add liquidity by minting GLP, and in return, they receive 70% of all fees generated on the corresponding blockchain. Unlike some liquidity pools, GLP experiences no impermanent loss. Furthermore, the GLP pool acts as a counterparty for traders. When GLP token holders supply liquidity for leveraged trading, they profit when traders incur losses, and the opposite is also true.

## How Many GMX Coins Are There in Circulation?

At the time of writing, the GMX token circulating supply is over 8.7M. The expected maximum supply is 13.25M GMX tokens.

The tokenomics is as follows: 6M GMX allocated for XVIX and Gambit migration; 2M GMX paired with ETH for liquidity on Uniswap; 2M GMX set aside for vesting from Escrowed GMX rewards; 2M GMX tokens to the floor price fund; 1M GMX tokens designated for marketing, collaborations and community developers; 250K GMX tokens distributed to the team linearly over a 2-year period.


## How Is the GMX Network Secured?

GMX is on the Arbitrum and Avalanche blockchain. 

Arbitrum is a layer-2 blockchain which derives its security from the Ethereum network, which provides consensus and finality for Arbitrum transactions. In other words, Ethereum guarantees the validity of the rollup’s off-chain computation and data availability behind the computation.

On Avalanche, unlike proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, the Avalanche consensus mechanism does not have one leader processing transactions that get validated by others. Instead, all nodes process and validate transactions by employing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) protocol. That way, transactions are processed simultaneously, and validators' random polling ensures that transactions are correct with statistical certainty. There are no blocks in this consensus mechanism, allowing immediate finalization and significantly improving the blockchain’s speed.

The GMX contracts are also audited by ABDK Consulting, and there is an active bug bounty for GMX on Immunefi.


## Where Can You Buy GMX?

GMX is available on several cryptocurrency exchanges, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/) and [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/).

## What Is FC Barcelona Fan Token (BAR)?

FC Barcelona Fan Token (BAR) is a utility token created in collaboration between FC Barcelona and [Chiliz](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chiliz/), a global blockchain financial technology provider for the sports and entertainment industry. Fan tokens are digital assets that never expire, and provide their holders with an ability to vote in polls and participate in quizzes & contests published on the Socios.com app - a sports fan engagement platform developed by Chiliz and built on Chiliz Chain.

$BAR is the one and only official [fan token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-fan-tokens) of Barça that provides fans with a tokenized share of influence in the life of their favorite club. The token was created with the aim of bringing the community closer together and attracting a global audience by making it easier to interact with the soccer team.

The launch of the BAR token took place in June 2020, BAR offered its owners the right to participate in surveys related to the activities of FC Barcelona, ​​plus the opportunity to earn unique prizes. Token holders vote using a smart contract, and FC Barcelona must take into account the outcome of the poll and implement the results.

Fan Tokens serve as a membership that allows users to compete for exclusive rewards and team recognition. Rewards include match tickets, exclusive fan experiences, Socios.com bonuses, club [NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) and digital badges. Through BAR, members can purchase VIP goods / services, VIP access to stadiums and match tickets, and rare collectible items. Users can stake BAR for NFT rewards, and also gain access to the gamified utility.

## Who Are the Founders of FC Barcelona Fan Token?

FC Barcelona probably needs no introduction. However, for those who don’t know, FC Barcelona (also known as Barça) is a professional football club from Barcelona, ​​Catalonia (ESP), founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, German and English footballers. Currently, Barça is one of the most popular and talented teams in the world with a huge fan base and massive social media support.

The team competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football. On the international stage, Barcelona has amassed the following trophies: 5 UEFA Champions League titles, 4 UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, 5 UEFA Super Cups, 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and 3 FIFA Club World Cups. Some of the most famous players of all time including Lionel Messi, Neymar, Ronaldinho and Diego Maradona have played for the club.

FC Barcelona Fan Token (BAR) was launched on June 22, 2020 through the Chiliz platform, in cooperation with Socios.com. [Chiliz (CHZ)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chiliz/) provides sports and entertainment organizations / clubs with a blockchain-based toolkit that helps them attract, grow and monetize their audience. The company's goal was to improve the existing fan experience and, thus, created a channel for interacting with fans. The platform was built from scratch on the Chiliz blockchain, and uses CHZ as the main currency. Moreover, the platform allows fans to purchase the official tokens of popular sports teams, including the FC Barcelona Fan Token (BAR).  

Alexandre Dreyfus is CEO of Chiliz and Socios.com. As a skilled web entrepreneur with over 20 years of digital experience, Dreyfus has an interesting resume. In the 90s, he developed an interactive travel guide known as Webcity. Later on, in the 00s, he founded two rather successful and major online poker projects such as Winamax and Chilipoker; then, in 2013, he became an owner of the Global Poker Index and The Hendon Mob. On top of that, in 2017 Dreyfus founded Chiliz, a digital currency for sports & entertainment platforms. And in 2018, Socios.com was born, with the goal of providing football and sports clubs with an opportunity to monetize their fan bases by introducing blockchain technology.

## What Makes FC Barcelona Fan Token Unique?

The key features of the BAR token are as follows:

To become part of the community, start influencing club decisions and participate in Fan Rewards contests, you must have at least one $BAR. However, the weight of your vote depends on the number of tokens you have, and some activities may require more than just one token.

Token holders have their own perks, including VIP access to the Camp Nou home stadium, the opportunity to meet world famous football legends, as well as the chance to attend autograph sessions and get signed items & team merch.

Barça uses Socios.com to get closer to fans and receive their opinions by posting polls. BAR holders can vote only once, but if a user has 10 tokens, then his vote will be counted as 10. To maintain fair results, polls are limited to a certain amount of tokens, which is set by the club itself.

The Socios platform has a bonus system, so BAR holders get VIP access to all home league, cup and European matches.

Coinweb,CWEB,coinweb,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/12089.png,token,"## What is Coinweb (CWEB)?
Coinweb (CWEB) is a revolutionary open-source, **consensus-free**, and decentralized platform that focuses on enhancing **scalability** and **interoperability**. It enables the deployment of dApps across multiple blockchains as if they were one.

One of Coinweb's standout features is its detached proof mechanisms within the InChain architecture. This unique approach transforms the blockchain landscape by ensuring groundbreaking interoperability, robust dApps, and unified cross-blockchain data. It accomplishes this by redefining how the state of a blockchain is verified, which greatly enhances the efficiency and functionality of dApps while retaining the properties of the underlying chains.

## Key Concept
Coinweb empowers scalable consensus-free validation across asynchronous shards, embedding them within self-sovereign blockchains like Bitcoin to ensure secure interoperability and limitless scalability.

## Computational Power
Coinweb's smart contract computation relies on batch sequential processing, supporting powerful parallel processing with various virtual machines, including WebAssembly and RISCV. It's designed to adapt to future massively parallel Layer 1 blockchains.

## Reactivity
Coinweb's brilliance extends to its smart contracts that transcend their own chains. They can detect actions on Layer 1 of interconnected blockchains, making cross-chain incentives programmable and seamless.

## The Problem at Hand
In the blockchain realm, many components depend on expensive distributed consensus mechanisms for validation, despite more efficient alternatives. This reliance leads to critical design flaws, resulting in issues such as high gas fees, vulnerabilities, fragmented liquidity, and limited interoperability—a major obstacle to realizing the full potential of blockchain technology.

## Coinweb's Innovative Solution
Unlike isolated solutions like ZK- and optimistic rollups that primarily enhance computation, Coinweb uniquely extends this concept to achieve unparalleled interoperability among independent Layer 1 blockchains using a detached proof mechanism. This transformation brings about:

**Empowerment:** dApps on Coinweb gain significant enhancements in capabilities while reducing operational costs.

**Unification:** The potential to unify data from various independent blockchains opens doors for dApps to generate unparalleled value.

**Autonomy:** dApps gain the ability to operate autonomously, leveraging the collective security and performance advantages of multiple underlying blockchains.

**Advancement:** This not only enhances the utility and security of existing blockchains and dApps but also drives increased liquidity, growth, and broader technology adoption.

## Current Adoption
Coinweb's technology has served over 600,000 unique users, facilitating more than 5,250,000 transactions across eight underlying chains, representing a total value exceeding $462 million in token sales through projects built on the platform.

## dApps on Coinweb
Coinweb currently hosts six dApps, with more in development. Notable dApps include:

1. **The Coinweb Wallet:** This wallet enables users to trade major cryptocurrencies, create cross-chain tokens, and engage in peer-to-peer transactions. It offers integrated fiat support, non-custodial portfolio management, real-time price data, and market information.

**2. LinkMint:** An ambitious platform simplifying custom cross-chain token creation, making advanced blockchain technologies accessible to non-crypto users. It supports features like minting, burning, vesting, bonding curves, and DAO applications.

**3. DeconX:** A simple marketplace for Coinweb Native token swaps and automated market-making operations. It also facilitates gas fee abstraction and offers a framework for smart contract interactions across blockchains.

**4. BMW Leasing Thailand Loyalty Programme:** A blockchain-based loyalty program in partnership with BMW Thailand, allowing customers to earn and redeem loyalty tokens.

Wrapped USDR,WUSDR,wrapped-usdr,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/24112.png,token,"Real USD (USDR v2) is a first-of-its-kind natively rebasing, yield-bearing, overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar. 

USDR is primarily collateralized by yield-generating, tokenized real estate.

Backing a stablecoin with Real Estate has 2 key competitive advantages that we believe add significant value to the stablecoin landscape:

1) Yield - The tokenized properties in the Real USD treasury are leased to tenants. This rental yield is paid out daily to holders in the form of a rebase.

In addition to this if Real USD ever falls beneath 100% collateralization ratio, 50% of the daily rebase  is instead added to the treasury to recollateralize USDR.

2) Real Estate price appreciation  - When priced in FIAT Real Estate has a long predictable history of appreciation. Over the last 50 years, the average sales price of a house in the United States grew from $27,000 in Q1 1970 to $383,000 in Q1 2020. 

This appreciation in the backing of USDR allows for interesting design mechanisms that contribute to additonal yield and lindyness of the system.","{""website"":[""https://www.tangible.store/realusd""],""technical_doc"":[],""explorer"":[""https://polygonscan.com/token/0x00e8c0E92eB3Ad88189E7125Ec8825eDc03Ab265"",""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xC03b43d492d904406db2d7D57e67C7e8234bA752"",""https://arbiscan.io/token/0x9483ab65847A447e36d21af1CaB8C87e9712ff93"",""https://bscscan.com/token/0x9467f15f44A8641389556387b43d9ED3f6981818"",""https://etherscan.io/token/0xC03b43d492d904406db2d7D57e67C7e8234bA752""],""source_code"":[],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/wrapped-usdr""],""chat"":[""https://discord.com/invite/tMQ9WjVBuS""],""announcement"":[],""reddit"":[],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/tangibleDAO""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3890.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x00e8c0E92eB3Ad88189E7125Ec8825eDc03Ab265"",""ContractPlatform"":""Polygon"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://polygonscan.com/token/0x00e8c0E92eB3Ad88189E7125Ec8825eDc03Ab265""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1839.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x9467f15f44A8641389556387b43d9ED3f6981818"",""ContractPlatform"":""BNB Smart Chain (BEP20)"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://bscscan.com/token/0x9467f15f44A8641389556387b43d9ED3f6981818""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/11841.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x9483ab65847A447e36d21af1CaB8C87e9712ff93"",""ContractPlatform"":""Arbitrum"",""ContractPRCURL"":[],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://arbiscan.io/token/0x9483ab65847A447e36d21af1CaB8C87e9712ff93""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1027.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0xd5a14081a34d256711b02bbef17e567da48e80b5"",""ContractPlatform"":""Ethereum"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://etherscan.io/token/0xd5a14081a34d256711b02bbef17e567da48e80b5""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/11840.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0xC03b43d492d904406db2d7D57e67C7e8234bA752"",""ContractPlatform"":""Optimism"",""ContractPRCURL"":[],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xC03b43d492d904406db2d7D57e67C7e8234bA752""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/27716.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x9483ab65847A447e36d21af1CaB8C87e9712ff93"",""ContractPlatform"":""Base"",""ContractPRCURL"":[],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://basescan.org/token/0x9483ab65847A447e36d21af1CaB8C87e9712ff93""}]",[],[]

HEX is an ERC20 token launched on the Ethereum network. HEX is designed to be a store of value to replace the Certificate of Deposit as the blockchain counterpart of that financial product used in traditional financial markets. HEX is also designed to leverage off the emerging DeFi (Decentralised Finance) ecosystem in cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum network. 

HEX uses the Ethereum network for the transaction layer (sending and receiving HEX tokens, as well as interacting with the HEX smart contract), whilst the consensus code and staking mechanism is contained in the HEX smart contract.

HEX allows a user to stake his or her HEX coins for a share of the new HEX coin issuance, or inflation and contains features designed to incentivize behaviors that encourage price appreciation and disincentivize behaviors that encourage harm to the price. The HEX smart contract penalizes stakers for ending their stake early and rewards them for staking larger amounts of HEX for longer periods.

HEX is distributed to Bitcoin holders by way of a snapshot of the Bitcoin UTXO set that occurred on 2 December 2019 at block height 606227. The distribution of HEX to Bitcoin holders is 10,000 HEX per 1 BTC. Bitcoin holders are able to claim HEX only during the first year of launch. During this period, HEX is also obtained in exchange for ETH through interacting with the HEX smart contract.

At the end of the first year of launch, all HEX coins that were not claimed by Bitcoin holders are distributed to the rest of the HEX users who have stakes that are active. The maximum possible annual inflation of HEX is designed to be 3.69% after the first year of launch.","{""website"":[""https://hex.com/"",""https://go.hex.win/""],""technical_doc"":[""https://hex.win/techspecs.html""],""explorer"":[""https://etherscan.io/token/0x2b591e99afe9f32eaa6214f7b7629768c40eeb39"",""https://ethplorer.io/address/0x2b591e99afe9f32eaa6214f7b7629768c40eeb39""],""source_code"":[""https://github.com/BitcoinHEX""],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/HEX_CMC"",""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/hex""],""chat"":[""https://t.me/HEXcrypto""],""announcement"":[""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4523610.0""],""reddit"":[""https://reddit.com/r/HEXcrypto""],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/HEXcrypto""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1027.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x2b591e99afe9f32eaa6214f7b7629768c40eeb39"",""ContractPlatform"":""Ethereum"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://etherscan.io/token/0x2b591e99afe9f32eaa6214f7b7629768c40eeb39""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3890.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x23D29D30e35C5e8D321e1dc9A8a61BFD846D4C5C"",""ContractPlatform"":""Polygon"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://polygonscan.com/token/0x23D29D30e35C5e8D321e1dc9A8a61BFD846D4C5C""}]","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9022.png"",""Name"":""Trust Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.trustwallet.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9025.png"",""Name"":""MetaMask"",""URL"":""https://metamask.io/""}]","[{""Auditor"":""CertiK"",""ReportUrl"":""https://cmc.certik-skynet.com/redirect?project=hex1""}]"
Osmosis,OSMO,osmosis,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/12220.png,coin,"## What Is Osmosis (OSMO)?

Osmosis (OSMO) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for [Cosmos](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/), an ecosystem of sovereign, interoperable blockchains all connected trustlessly over IBC, [the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol](https://ibcprotocol.org/). Osmosis also offers non-IBC assets bridged from the Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems. Originally based on Balancer-style pools, Osmosis is moving to a more sustainable [concentrated liquidity](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/concentrated-liquidity) model that provides a superior trading and liquidity provision experience.

As an [appchain DEX](https://medium.com/nascent-xyz/the-inevitability-of-unichain-bc600c92c5c4), Osmosis has greater control over the full blockchain stack than DEXs that must follow the code of a parent chain. This fine-grained control has enabled, for example, the development of [Superfluid Staking](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/insights-analysis/what-is-superfluid-staking), an improvement to [Proof-of-Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) security. Superfluid staking allows the underlying OSMO in an LP position to add to chain security and earn staking rewards for doing so. The customizability of appchains also allows for the development of a transaction [mempool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mempool) shielded with [threshold encryption](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/898), which will greatly reduce harmful MEV on Osmosis. 

Osmosis's vision is to build a [cross-chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cross-chain) native DEX and trading suite that connects all chains over IBC, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. To build out the trading functionalities, Osmosis has invited external developers to create a bespoke [DEX ecosystem](https://osmosis.zone/ecosystem) that includes lending, credit, margin, fiat on-ramps, Defi strategy vaults, NFTs, stablecoins, and more – all the functionalities of a centralized exchange and more, plus the trust-minimization of decentralized finance.   

## Who Are The Founders Of Osmosis?

Osmosis was launched by the members of two core Cosmos teams: Sunny Aggarwal and Dev Ojha from [Sikka](https://sikka.tech/) validator and [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/), and Josh Lee and Tony Yun from [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/), the Interchain Wallet.

One of the investors in Osmosis is Paradigm, a digital asset investment firm with stakes in countless other blockchains and protocols like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Maker](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maker/), and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) to name a few.

## What Makes Osmosis Unique?

The Osmosis blockchain protocol has three key strengths that set it apart from other AMM money market protocols.

First, Osmosis has **customizable liquidity pools**. Unlike Uniswap, where LPs can provide liquidity only to a two-token pool with an equal ratio, Osmosis allows for providing liquidity to pools with several tokens and unequal ratios. Osmosis argues that agents in a maturing DeFi market like arbitrageurs and LPs need a more flexible solution that allows them to self-identify opportunities and react to them by adjusting parameters. Thus, on Osmosis LPs can adjust factors slippage, transaction fees, and more.

Coordination between stakeholders is of equal importance, which is why liquidity pool shares on Osmosis are not only used to calculate the fractional ownership of a liquidity pool, but also the right to participate in the strategic decision-making of the liquidity pool as well. This incentivizes long-term liquidity provision and prevents possible vampire attacks from other protocols. Thus, liquidity providers with more skin in the game get a bigger say in the strategic direction of the pool, which is in line with the bigger risk they're taking. 

Finally, Osmosis introduces the idea of ""AMMs as serviced infrastructure."" With an increase in the amount and complexity of DeFi products, AMMs have had to:

* Compromise efficiency and trade on AMMs with non-optimal bonding curves.
* Take on the risk of building a custom AMM to maximize efficiency.

Osmosis wants to remedy that by providing AMM creators with an option to define the bonding curve value function and reuse the rest of the infrastructure using Osmosis' products.

## How Many Osmosis (OSMO) Coins Are There in Circulation?

OSMO is the protocol's [governance token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token) with a [total supply](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-supply) of 1 billion. At genesis, 100 million OSMO was released, split evenly between [airdrop](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/airdrop) recipients and a strategic reserve. Tokens are being released at the end of each daily epoch and follow a ""thirdening"" schedule, meaning token issuance is cut by a third each year. In the first year, 300 million OSMO will be released, in the second 200 million OSMO, in the third 133 million OSMO, and so on. Newly released tokens are distributed as follows:


* Staking Rewards: 25%
* Developer Vesting: 25%
* Liquidity Mining Incentives: 45%
* Community Pool: 5%** **

The total token distribution is as follows:

* Liquidity Reward Mining: 40.5%
* Developer Vesting: 22.5%
* Staking Reward: 22.5%
* Community Pool: 4.5%
* Strategic Reserve: 5%
* Airdrop: 5%


## How Is the Osmosis Network Secured?

Osmosis is a sovereign [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) blockchain with its own [validator set](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/validators).


## Where Can You Buy Osmosis (OSMO)?

OSMO is available on [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/), [Binance.com](https://www.binance.com), [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/), and [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com/).

Its [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) execution platform is reportedly capable of 15,000 transactions per second, six-second latency and a $0.001 transaction cost.

MultiversX rewards the community and active participants with EGLD tokens. EGLD, or Electronic Gold, is Elrond's native token. It acts as a store of value currency to pay for network usage. The coin also serves as a medium of exchange between platform users and validators. Users pay transaction fees in EGLD and validators provide services.

EGLD allows developers to deploy smart contracts, protocols, and dApps on the platform. It empowers participants to perform any network action. Through [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) and validation rewards, as well as transaction fees, EGLD manages the Elrond network. Plus, EGLD is endowed with the functionality of a governance token, so its holders can vote on network decisions.

MultiversX was first announced in August 2019, and its mainnet went live in July 2020.


### Who Are the Founders of MultiversX?

MultiversX was co-founded in late 2017 by brothers Beniamin and Lucian Mincu alongside Lucian Todea as a solution to the problem of blockchain scalability, which they thought to be the most pressing problem facing the industry.

Prior to MultiversX, Beniamin and Lucian Mincu co-founded MetaChain Capital, a digital asset investment fund, with Beniamin Mincu serving as CEO and Lucian Mincu as chief technology officer. The two also co-founded ICO Market Data, an aggregator of information around [initial coin offerings](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico).

Beniamin Mincu was also responsible for product, marketing and community for blockchain platform [NEM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nem/) from 2014 to 2015, in addition to being an early investor in projects such as [Zilliqa](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zilliqa/) (ZIL), [Tezos](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tezos/) (XTZ), Brave and [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance). Lucian Mincu has additional experience as an information technology engineer and security specialist, having worked with Uhrenwerk 24, Cetto and Liebl Systems.

Lucian Todea is a serial tech entrepreneur who previously founded and served as CEO of Soft32, a software review and download site, and a partner of mobilPay, a mobile payments application. He is also an angel investor, having invested in biometrics tech company TypingDNA and accounting platform SmartBill.


#### What Makes MultiversX Unique?

MultiversX describes itself as a blockchain platform for the new internet economy, [decentralized applications](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) and enterprise use. Its main selling point is its high scalability, stating that it is the first blockchain network in which state, network and transaction sharding have all been implemented. According to its economics paper, it seeks to build up its ecosystem and establish EGLD as a store-of-value asset.

To achieve this goal, the network runs on 3,200 validator nodes split into four shards: three execution shards, capable of 5,400 transactions per second each, and one coordination shard, the ""Metachain."" MultiversX's adaptive state sharding architecture completely shards state, transactions and network. It can scale by adding an additional shard when the throughput demand is unmet. It was tested to run 263,000 TPS in a public environment with 1,500 nodes from 29 countries grouped in 50 shards.

In order to increase adoption, the project also supports developers building on the platform, allowing them to earn 30% of the smart contract fees as royalties.

The company maintains a supply of EGLD tokens to stake on the network during its first year, with validator nodes receiving a 36% annual percentage rate.

### How Does MultiversX Work?

According to the MultiversX crypto team, the project implements three types of segmentation: state, transactions, and network, using the parallel processing method to speed up the time and increase the number of transactions.

MultiversX is a comprehensive software that uses Adaptive State Sharding to scale while sharing infrastructure to support a growing number of applications/transactions on the ledger. A variation of the traditional [PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) operational protocol guarantees the connection to the platform of all sections of the network, separated during sharding. Hence, the integrated environment is involved in the development of dApps, which are imitations of products and services.

MultiversX developers combined three sharding methods to create their own unique adaptive one. They divide the network into four shards: three shards are execution shards that process transactions, validating 5400 transactions per second, and Metachain is the fourth shard that coordinates and completes transactions. 

Sharding types include: **State sharding** where the history of the network, or state, is distributed across different sections of the network, or shards. Segments have their own ledger, nodes store the state of each segment; **Transaction sharding** where transactions are mapped to segments and processed, segments process transactions in parallel and nodes capture the state of the entire network; **Network sharding** where the nodes are grouped into segments and then processed. Network slicing contributes to optimizing communications.


#### How Many MultiversX (EGLD) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The MultiversX economic model has a limited supply that starts at 20,000,000 EGLD, with new tokens minted to reward network validators. The maximum supply can never exceed 31,415,926 EGLD, but this number will decrease as more transactions are processed.

MultiversX's native token was first made available for purchase through a private sale, in which 19% of its initial supply was sold, with 7.5% made available immediately upon token generation and another 15.41% released every three months. MultiversX also held an [initial exchange offering](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-exchange-offering) on Binance, in which 25% was [sold](https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/360029716271-Introducing-the-Elrond-ERD-Token-Sale-on-Binance-Launchpad) and made available immediately. 

Of the remaining 56%, 7% was reserved for ecosystem rewards, with 50% released immediately and 50% after six months; 8.5% for marketing, grants and an accelerator pool for DApp developers, with 81.17% released immediately and 9.41% every six months; 2% for a community fund, with 33.3% released immediately, 33.3% after six months and 33.3% after 12 months; 2.5% for advisors, released after one year; 19% for MultiversX's founders and core team members, with 10% released after six months, 10% after 12 months, 15% after 18, 24, 30 and 36, and 20% after 42 months; and 17% for the company for ecosystem support, with 33.3% that can only be used for staking during the first year released immediately and 66.6% released in three equal installments over three years, starting after one year.

MultiversX's tokens were first issued on Binance Chain under the name ERD with a total supply of 20 billion. 500 million were burned in November 2019 and minted on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain as [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens, and the company [launched](https://elrond.com/blog/elrond-token-swap-bridge/) a token swap event in September 2020 for token holders to swap their ERC-20 and BEP-2 tokens for mainnet EGLD tokens. During the process, the total token supply was reduced from 20 billion to 20 million by setting the swap ratio at 1,000 ERD for 1 EGLD.


### How Is MultiversX Secured?

MultiversX uses what it calls a secure [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm in which nodes must stake their EGLD tokens to participate in the validation process, and each validator is assigned a rating score based on past activity, which also influences whether or not they are selected. If a validator's rating becomes too low, it will not be selected and must pay fines. Validators can also be removed from the network and have their stakes slashed if they continuously act in a manner that is against the integrity of the network.

Validators are randomly selected in a way that can be neither predicted nor modified based on the previous round of validations. In addition, validators are periodically shuffled between shards as a way to prevent collusion. Nodes communicate among one another using modified Boneh-Lynn-Shacham, or BLS, multi-signatures for strong cryptographic protection.


### Where Can You Buy MultiversX (EGLD)?

EGLD can be purchased on [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) exchanges such as [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/), [Bitfinex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitfinex/) and [BitMax](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitmax/).

Frax Share,FXS,frax-share,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/6953.png,token,"## What Is the Frax Protocol (FRAX)?

The Frax Protocol is the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin system. Frax is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain – currently implemented on Ethereum (with possible cross chain implementations in the future). The end goal of the Frax protocol is to provide a highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC. The protocol incorporates the following concepts:


Fractional-Algorithmic – Frax is a unique stablecoin with parts of its supply backed by collateral and parts of the supply algorithmic. The ratio of collateralized and algorithmic depends on the market's pricing of the FRAX stablecoin. If FRAX is trading at above $1, the protocol decreases the collateral ratio. If FRAX is trading at under $1, the protocol increases the collateral ratio. 

Decentralized & Governance-minimized – Community governed and emphasizing a highly autonomous, algorithmic approach with no active management. 

Fully on-chain oracles – Frax v1 uses Uniswap (ETH, USDT, USDC time-weighted average prices) and Chainlink (USD price) oracles. 

Two Tokens – FRAX is the stablecoin targeting a tight band around $1/coin. Frax Shares (FXS) is the governance token which accrues fees, seigniorage revenue, and excess collateral value.


Before Frax, stablecoins were divided into three different categories: fiat collateralized, overcollateralized with cryptocurrency, and algorithmic with no collateral. Frax is the first kind of decentralized stablecoin to classify itself as fractional-algorithmic ushering in the 4th and most unique category. 

## How Many FRAX and FXS Coins Are There in Circulation?

The supply of the FRAX stablecoin is dynamic and always changing to keep the price at $1 due to its fractional-algorithmic monetary policy. The supply of the Frax Shares (FXS) tokens are hard capped to 100 million tokens at genesis with no inflation schedule in the protocol. The FXS token is the governance token which accrues all value of new minted FRAX, fees, and excess collateral. FXS is an investment and governance asset while FRAX is the currency token. 

### What Makes Frax Unique? 
The Frax Protocol is a community driven and unique design stablecoin. Over 60% of the supply of FXS is issued over a number of years to liquidity providers and yield farmers. It is an entirely decentralized protocol with governance onchain. It is also the first and only stablecoin to incorporate the fractional-algorithmic hybrid design at the time of its launch in November 2020. 

### Who Are the Founders of the Frax Protocol?

The Frax Protocol is the brainchild of American software developer Sam Kazemian who came up with the first idea of a fractional-algorithmic stablecoin in 2019. 

The founding team of Frax engineers includes Travis Moore and Jason Huan. Sam Kazemian originally devised the idea when he noticed that stablecoins were growing rapidly but none had any mixture of algorithmic monetary policy and collateralization. Projects that had purely algorithmic monetary policy had failed or shut down without any significant traction. Frax was designed as an answer to measure the market’s confidence in a partly algorithmic and partly collateralized stablecoin.

Rocket Pool,RPL,rocket-pool,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2943.png,token,"## What Is Rocket Pool (RPL)?

[Rocket Pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rocket-pool/) is a decentralized [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) staking pool offering up to 4.33% APR for ETH2 [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking). Users can join the Rocket Pool with its decentralized node operator network or run their own nodes with only 16 ETH. In the latter case, they can earn a commission from staking ETH and earn additional RPL rewards from providing RPL collateral, amounting to up to 6.36% APR for ETH and the additional RPL rewards.

Rocket Pool provides liquid staking, meaning users benefit from an increasing exchange rate instead of adding on to their initial staked collateral, which would be a taxable event. Furthermore, Rocket Pool offers smart nodes: a custom node software allowing anyone to run a node on its network. With losses from bad nodes distributed across the network, individual users minimize their risk of facing penalties. This is supported by the pool’s open-source and audited smart contracts, which guarantee fully [non-custodial](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-custodial) staking and a maximum degree of decentralization. 


## Who Are the Founders of Rocket Pool?

Rocket Pool was launched by David Rugendyke, a senior developer with a computer science background who started designing Rocket Pool in late 2016. He is supported by General Manager Darren Langley, an executive with over 18 years of commercial experience in managing and mentoring development teams, designing application architecture, and delivering exciting digital products for government and financial services. The team is complemented by three blockchain and Solidity engineers with a combined 40 years of experience. 


## What Makes Rocket Pool Unique?

Rocket Pool essentially offers anyone to participate in ETH2 staking, regardless of their capital investment or level of technological sophistication. Its core premise is to enable the trustless staking of ETH to a network of decentralized autonomous nodes that are underpinned by RPL collateral. 

Rocket Pool sees itself as a complement to staking-as-a-service providers. These providers can choose to maximize returns by joining Rocket Pool and running a node, which they receive rewards in ETH and RPL for in return. In this manner, even a big player like Gemini could use Rocket Pool by creating nodes that stake 16 ETH each. This is where Rocket Pool’s staked ETH wrapper rETH comes into play.

rETH is a tokenized version of the staked ETH in Rocket Pool, which allows stakers to engage from 0.01 ETH to up to 32 ETH. By staking their Ether, users receive rETH in return, which automatically accrues staking rewards based on the performance of the entire network of node operators. The value of rETH is protected against slashing through insurance mechanisms, with node operators staking RPL on nodes as collateral for any penalties they incur.

The second way of interacting with Rocket Pool is through Node Staking. Users can deposit 16 ETH and are assigned an additional 16 ETH from users who are depositing ETH and receiving rETH. In essence, you stake your own 16 ETH and 16 ETH on behalf of the protocol. Rocket Pool automatically adjusts its commission rate based on the supply and demand of node operators and available ETH. With this model, node operators are rewarded for providing insurance for stakers in case they are penalized or slashed. Furthermore, node operators must deposit a minimum amount of RPL as a collateral.

## How Many Rocket Pool (RPL) Coins Are There in Circulation?

RPL follows a different approach than most fixed-supply [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) tokens and introduced a 5% annual inflation. The protocol argues that any value-generating protocol will need to reward its participants. A fixed-supply model would result in this value being generated at the expense of its users. 

The newly issued RPL tokens will be emitted as follows: 



*  Node Operators staking RPL as insurance collateral (70%)
*  Oracle DAO members providing various oracle data (15%)
*  Protocol DAO Treasury to fund decentralized development (15%)

This model is designed to incentivize the protocol’s key stakeholders and funds further decentralized development. The Oracle DAO members consist of node operators, ensuring that [oracle](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/oracles) data is reported correctly to the protocol, while the Protocol DAO governs the protocol’s treasury. At the time of writing, the supply of RPL is just over 10 million. 


## How Is the Rocket Pool Network Secured?

RPL is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token on Ethereum. Rocket Pool has been successfully audited by three separate firms: Sigma Prime, Consensys Diligence, and Trail of Bits. It also runs a bug bounty program to incentivize keeping its protocol safe. 

Furthermore, [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) of Rocket Pool is split across its Protocol DAO and Oracle DAO. The Protocol DAO is responsible for settings like RPL inflation, rewards, and auctions, the staking requirements and commissions for nodes, and deposits. The Oracle DAO bridges the [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) between the Beacon Chain and the ETH1 main chain. Members of the Oracle DAO are several big ETH2 staking clients like Lighthouse, Nimbus, Prysm, ConsenSys Codefi, Blockchain Capital, Bankless, and others. 


## Where Can You Buy Rocket Pool (RPL)?

RPL is available on [UniSwap (V3)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v3/), [Hoo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hoo/), [BKEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bkex/), [XT.COM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/xt/), [Hotbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotbit/), and [Bvnex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bvnex/).

Polygon,MATIC,polygon,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3890.png,coin,"## What Is Polygon (MATIC)?

[Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-polygon-matic) (previously Matic Network) is the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. Its core component is Polygon SDK, a modular, flexible framework that supports building multiple types of applications.

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Polygon Matic](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-polygon-matic).

Using Polygon, one can create [optimistic rollup](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/optimistic-rollups-for-the-rest-of-us) chains, [ZK rollup](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zero-knowledge-rollups) chains, stand alone chains or any other kind of infra required by the developer.

Polygon effectively transforms Ethereum into a full-fledged multi-chain system (aka Internet of Blockchains). This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc. with the advantages of Ethereum’s security, vibrant ecosystem and openness.

The $MATIC token will continue to exist and will play an increasingly important role, securing the system and enabling governance.

Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a [Layer 2](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) scaling solution backed by Binance and Coinbase. The project seeks to stimulate mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by resolving the problems of scalability on many blockchains.

Polygon combines the Plasma Framework and the proof-of-stake blockchain architecture. The Plasma framework used by Polygon as proposed by the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, allows for the easy execution of scalable and autonomous smart contracts.

Nothing will change for the existing ecosystem built on the Plasma-POS chain. With Polygon, new features are being built around the existing proven technology to expand the ability to cater to diverse needs from the developer ecosystem. Polygon will continue to develop the core technology so that it can scale to a larger ecosystem.

Polygon boasts of up to 65,000 transactions per second on a single side chain, along with a respectable block confirmation time of less than two seconds. The framework also allows for the creation of globally available decentralized financial applications on a single foundational blockchain.

The Plasma framework gives Polygon the potential of housing an unlimited number of decentralized applications on their infrastructure without experiencing the normal drawbacks common on proof-of-work blockchains. So far, Polygon has attracted more than 50 DApps to its PoS-secured Ethereum sidechain.

MATIC, the native tokens of Polygon, is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token running on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokens are used for payment services on Polygon and as a settlement currency between users who operate within the Polygon ecosystem. The transaction fees on Polygon [sidechains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/side-chain) are also paid in MATIC tokens.


### Who Are the Founders of Polygon?

Polygon (formerly Matic Network) was launched in October 2017. Polygon was co-founded by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun, two experienced blockchain developers and a business consultant.

Before moving to its network in 2019, the Polygon team was a huge contributor in the Ethereum ecosystem. The team worked on implementing the Plasma MVP, the WalletConnect protocol and the widely-used Dagger event notification engine on Ethereum.

The team included co-founder of Polygon, Jaynti Kanani. Jaynti, a full-stack developer and blockchain engineer currently serves as the CEO of Polygon.

Jaynti played an integral role in implementing Web3, Plasma and the WalletConnect protocol on Ethereum. Prior to his blockchain involvement, Jaynti worked as a data scientist with Housing.com.

Co-founder and chief operations officer of Polygon, Sandeep Nailwal is a blockchain programmer and entrepreneur. Before jointly starting Polygon (formerly Matic), Sandeep had served as the CEO of Scopeweaver, and the chief technical officer of Welspun Group.

Anurag Arjun is the only non-programming co-founder of Polygon. As a product manager, he has had stints with IRIS Business, SNL Financial, Dexter Consultancy and Cognizant Technologies.


## What Makes Polygon Unique?

Polygon is self-described as a Layer 2 scaling solution, which means that the project doesn’t seek to upgrade its current basic blockchain layer any time soon. The project focuses on reducing the complexity of scalability and instant blockchain transactions.

Polygon uses a customized version of the Plasma framework which is built on[ proof-of-stake](http://https:%2F%2Fblog.coinmarketcap.com%2F2018%2F10%2F19%2Fa-short-primer-on-proof-of-stake%2F/) checkpoints that run through the Ethereum main-chain. This unique technology allows each sidechain on Polygon to achieve up to 65,536 transactions per block.

Commercially, the sidechains of Polygon are structurally designed to support a variety of decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) protocols available in the Ethereum ecosystem.

While Polygon currently supports only Ethereum basechain, the network intends to extend support for additional basechains, based on community suggestions and consensus. This would make Polygon an interoperable decentralized Layer 2 blockchain platform

### Polygon (MATIC) London Hard Fork and EIP-1559 Upgrade

Polygon announced the much-anticipated London Hard Fork and Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 upgrade will go live on the mainnet on Jan. 18, 2022. The upgrade will completely change the way the fee mechanism works on the Ethereum network — it eliminates first-price auction as the main fee calculation mechanism and instead uses a base fee that is burned, instead of sent to miners. Although it does not lower transaction fees, it makes it more stable, allowing users to estimate costs better and reduce overpayment. 

However, as MATIC tokens are burned as base fees — and MATIC has a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens — it will have a deflationary effect on the digital asset. Polygon’s core team projected an annual burn of MATIC amounting to 0.27% of the token’s total supply — around 27 million tokens. This deflationary pressure will most likely benefit validators and delegators the most, as rewards for processing transactions on Polygon are denominated in MATIC. Furthermore, base fee will increase automatically once the block is filled up, resulting in fewer spam transactions and less network congestion. Ethereum mainnet’s [London Hard Fork went live](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereums-london-hard-fork-goes-live) on Aug. 5, 2021.

## Polygon Network Carbon Neutrality

Polygon is one of the multiple blockchains achieving carbon neutrality. That initiative is part of [Polygon's Green Manifesto](https://blog.polygon.technology/our-green-manifesto/), which aims to focus on sustainable development for blockchain. Polygon [committed](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-is-going-carbon-negative-in-2022-with-a-20-million-pledge/) $20 million for various community initiatives to utilize Web3 technology to build a sustainable future for all. That includes focusing on new solutions for on-chain carbon credit retirement.

Through a partnership with [KlimaDAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/klimadao/), Polygon bought $400,000 worth of carbon credits. Those credits represent nearly 90,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions. The tokens were [retired](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-reaches-first-sustainability-milestone-by-achieving-carbon-neutrality/) through KlimaDAO's offset aggregator tool, with BCT and MCO2 carbon credits created from offsets certified under the Verified Carbon Standard.

KlimaDAO is a decentralized collective of environmentalists, entrepreneurs, and developers looking to modernize the carbon market through on-chain technology.

Furthermore, KlimaDAO and Offsetra analyzed Polygon's network energy footprint to determine emission hotspots and figure out a compelling mitigation approach. That includes looking at emissions from staking node hardware, the energy consumption of staking operations and more,

Becoming carbon neutral is the first step for Polygon toward sustainability. Even though the network relies on proof-of-stake, far more energy-efficient than proof-of-work, the network continues to impact the environment. That applies to both Polygon-only activity and the native smart contracts interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. 

Polygon and KlimaDAO have also retired carbon credits from various network-native projects, including Bull Run Forest Conservation Project, the Ghani Solar Power Project, Moss.Earth and the wind power project at Jaibhim, India.

## How Many Polygon (MATIC) Tokens Are There in Circulation?

MATIC tokens are released on a monthly basis. MATIC currently has a circulating supply of 4,877,830,774 MATIC tokens and a max supply of 10,000,000,000 MATIC tokens.

At its initial private sale in 2017, 3.8 percent of MATIC’s max supply was issued. In the April 2019 launchpad sale, another 19 percent of the total supply was sold. The MATIC price was $0.00263 per token, and $5 million was generated.

The remaining MATIC tokens are distributed as follows:



* **Team tokens:** 16 percent of the total supply.
* **Advisors tokens:** 4 percent of the total supply.
* **Network Operations tokens:** 12 percent of the total supply.
* **Foundation tokens**: 21.86 percent of the total supply.
* **Ecosystem tokens:** 23.33 percent of the total supply.

According to the release schedule, all the tokens will be released by December 2022.


## How Is the Polygon Secured?

As a[ Layer 2 solution](https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/ethereum-layer-2-scaling-solution-optimism-preliminary-mainnet-january-15/) utilizing a network of proof-of-stake validators for asset security, staking is an integral part of the Polygon ecosystem. Validators on the network will stake their MATIC tokens as collateral to become part of the network’s PoS consensus mechanism and will receive MATIC tokens in return.

Members of the network who do not wish to become validators can delegate their MATIC tokens to another validator, but will still take part in their staking process and earn staking rewards.

In addition to the proof-of-stake checkpointing, Polygon uses block producers at the block producer layer to achieve a higher degree of decentralization. These block producers give finality to the main chains using checkpoints and fraud-proof mechanisms.


## Where Can You Buy Polygon (MATIC)?

Being one of the projects that contributed a lot to the development of the Ethereum ecosystem, MATIC is popular among online exchanges focused on DeFi. The top exchanges where you can buy, sell, and trade MATIC currently are:



* [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)

Kava,KAVA,kava,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/4846.png,token,"## What Is Kava (KAVA)?

Kava is a Layer-1 blockchain that combines the speed and interoperability of Cosmos with the developer power of Ethereum. 

Kava was built from the ground up to optimize its resources for protocol growth, strengthened by its Cosmos EVM technology that enables maximum scalability, speed, security, and developer support.

Builders on Kava earn a share of Kava Rise's $750M developer incentive fund via the program's blockchain-based distribution method, designed to reward the top protocols every month based on usage.


### Who Are the Founders of Kava?

Kava has always put security and decentralization first. Today, the Kava blockchain ecosystem is developed by over 100 application protocol teams (and counting), and is supported by over 100 infrastructure teams.

The Kava ecosystem is supported by multiple independent international Foundations which are responsible for allocating protocol-level funding to grantees with the purpose of supporting the health and continued development of decentralized networks and systems.


#### What Makes Kava Unique?

**Seamless Interoperability:** Kava provides seamless interoperability between Cosmos and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to enable developers to build in whichever environment they want without sacrificing access to users and assets.

**Protocol Growth:** The on-chain incentive program, Kava Rise, ensures that the best builders in the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems are properly rewarded for driving growth on Kava. 

**Optimized Scalability:** Kava’s architecture enables the free flow of users, assets, and projects between Kava and the industry's most prominent ecosystems at scale, all powered by the lightning-fast Tendermint Core consensus engine.

**Cross-chain Interoperability:**  Kava’s unique co-chain architecture enables seamless asset transfers and interactions between the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems, unlocking new opportunities and broadening access for developers and users alike.

#### How Many Kava (KAVA) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The KAVA token was first launched in 2019 with a Binance Launchpad educational event. All vesting KAVA has been unlocked and Kava’s proof-of-stake’s consensus mechanism emits tokens to incentivize validators to secure the network. A portion of emitted tokens are also utilized in initiatives like Kava Rise to further the decentralization, security, and stability of the Kava ecosystem.


### How Is the Kava Network Secured?

Kava is built on Cosmos, and uses a Tendermint-based [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POS) [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) to ensure the integrity of the network. 

This uses a network of validator nodes for confirming transactions. These validator nodes must put up collateral to take up the duty of validating transactions. If validators misbehave or fail to meet rigorous minimum requirements, their stake will be penalized — thereby incentivizing validators to remain honest and efficient. 

Kava holders can run a staking node to earn KAVA rewards directly from the protocol. However, only the top 100 Kava nodes (also known as validators) are eligible to receive these rewards. Beyond this, KAVA holders can stake their tokens on various compatible exchange platforms, like Binance, Kraken, Huobi Pool, and in wallets like Trust Wallet, Cosmostation Wallet, and Keplr.

Kava's [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) have been audited by multiple independent blockchain and crypto security firms, including CertiK, B-Harvest and Quantstamp. To date, no vulnerabilities have been found.


### Kava Governance

The KavaDAO is a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governing the Kava Network. KAVA stakers and validators secure and run the network; thus, their responsibility is to table and vote on proposals that affect the Kava Network.

These changes can take the form of smart contract modifications, adjustments to the global debt limit, the addition or removal of collateral assets, among other considerations. 


### Where Can You Buy Kava (KAVA)?

KAVA tokens can be traded on over a dozen exchange platforms, and there are now a wide variety of KAVA trading pairs available, the most popular of which include: KAVA/USDT, KAVA/BTC and KAVA/BNB. 

As of March 2022, [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) is the most liquid exchange for KAVA tokens, whereas [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/) is the only exchange to offer KAVA/EUR and KAVA/USD trading pairs.

Cardano,ADA,cardano,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2010.png,coin,"## What Is Cardano (ADA)?

Cardano is a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) blockchain platform that says its goal is to allow “changemakers, innovators and visionaries” to bring about positive global change.

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Cardano](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/cardano).

The open-source project also aims to “redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins to individuals” — helping to create a society that is more secure, transparent and fair.

Cardano was founded back in 2017, and named after the 16th century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano. The native ADA token takes its name from the 19th century mathematician Ada Lovelace, widely regarded as the world’s first computer programmer. The ADA token is designed to ensure that owners can participate in the operation of the network. Because of this, those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes to the software.

The team behind the layered blockchain say that there have already been some compelling use cases for its technology, which aims to allow decentralized apps and smart contracts to be developed with modularity.

In August 2021, Charles Hoskinson announced the launch of the Alonzo hard fork, causing Cardano price to surge, gaining 116% in the following month. On Sept. 12, 2021, the Cardano ‘[Alonzo](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-cardanos-new-testnet-launch)’ [hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hard-fork-blockchain) officially launched, bringing [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) functionality to the blockchain. Over 100 smart contracts were deployed in the following 24 hours after the launch.

Cardano is used by agricultural companies to track fresh produce from field to fork, while other products built on the platform allow educational credentials to be stored in a tamper-proof way, and retailers to clamp down on counterfeit goods.


## Who Are the Founders of Cardano?

Cardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson, who was also one of the co-founders of the Ethereum network. He is the CEO of IOHK, the company that built Cardano’s blockchain.

In an interview for[ CoinMarketCap’s Crypto Titans series](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/05/11/charles-hoskinson-on-the-power-of-crypto-working-from-home-and-mongolian-hunting-falcons-2/), Hoskinson said that he got involved in cryptocurrencies back in 2011 — and dabbled in mining and trading. He explained that his first professional involvement in the industry came in 2013, when he created a course about Bitcoin that ended up being taken by 80,000 students.

As well as being a technology entrepreneur, Hoskinson is also a mathematician. In 2020, his technology company donated ADA worth $500,000 to the University of Wyoming’s Blockchain Research and Development Lab.


### What Makes Cardano Unique?

Cardano is one of the biggest blockchains to successfully use a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is less energy intensive than the proof-of-work algorithm relied upon by Bitcoin. Although the much larger Ethereum is going to be [upgrading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0) to PoS, this transition is only going to take place gradually.

The project has taken pride in ensuring that all of the technology developed goes through a process of peer-reviewed research, meaning that bold ideas can be challenged before they are validated. According to the Cardano team, this academic rigor helps the blockchain to be durable and stable — increasing the chance that potential pitfalls can be anticipated in advance.

In 2020, Cardano held a Shelley upgrade that aimed to make its blockchain “50 to 100 times more decentralized” than other large blockchains. At the time, Hoskinson predicted that this would pave the way for hundreds of assets to run on its network.

The Alonzo hard fork launch in September 2021 will bring an end to the Shelley era, and usher in the Goguen phase. Users can develop and deploy smart contracts on Cardano, allowing native decentralized applications (DApps) to be built on blockchain. Cardano price broke the $3 mark and hit an all-time high of $3.101 on Sept. 2, 2021, ahead of the launch. 

## What Is Cardano’s Vasil Hard Fork?

Named after late Bulgarian mathematician Vasil Dabov, a prominent contributor to Cardano, the Vasil hard fork is touted as one of the most highly-anticipated upgrades for Cardano. The hard fork is the third development epoch of Cardano and is supposed to introduce several upgrades to the blockchain’s smart contract programming language Plutus and the network’s capacity.

The event was originally billed to happen in June 2022, but has been postponed a number of times.

Vasil will introduce five critical mechanisms to improve Cardano’s scalability and usability — CIP-31, CIP-32, CIP-33, CIP-40 and diffusion pipelining.

CIP-31, aka “reference inputs” will introduce a new kind of input that would allow developers to look at the result of an output without having to spend it. This would optimize transaction throughput and increase concurrency.

The CIP-32 proposal aims to enable inline datums. Rather than attach datum to datum hashes, which is the current state of things, CIP-32 would allow developers to attach datums to outputs. By implementing this update, devs can code scripts that directly point to the input, making room for simpler and quicker communication of datum values between users.

The Cardano Improvement Proposal 33 would allow reference scripts to be attached to outputs. As a result, the reference scripts are used to satisfy the validation requirements in place of the spending transaction. These reference scripts will make the validation process more efficient and reduce the size of transactions.

Meanwhile, CIP-40 features a brand-new type of output to transactions called collateral outputs, aimed at improving the overall scalability of the network.

Diffusing pipelining is Cardano’s consensus layer scaling solution. The improvement proposal will see more DApp deployment by overlaying some of the steps that a block needs to go through as it moves across the chain: this would allow for concurrent transactions.

### How Many Cardano (ADA) Coins Are There in Circulation?

There is a maximum supply of 45 billion ADA — but at the time of writing, there was a circulating supply of about 31 billion. Five rounds of public sales of Cardano tokens were held between September 2015 and January 2017. Cardano price during its pre-launch sale was $0.0024, which represents an over 1000x return, given Cardano price now.

Approximately 2.5 billion ADA was allotted to IOHK once the network launched. Meanwhile, an additional 2.1 billion ADA was given to Emurgo, a global blockchain technology company that served as a founding entity of the Cardano protocol. Last but not least, 648 million ADA was given to the not-for-profit Cardano Foundation, which aims to promote the platform and increase levels of adoption.

Overall, about 16% of ADA’s total supply went to the project’s founders, with the remaining 84% being split among investors.


### How Is the Cardano Network Secured?

Cardano is secured through an “environmentally sustainable, verifiably secure” PoS protocol that’s known as Ouroboros.

The project says that Ouroboros improves upon the security guarantees that are delivered by a PoW consensus mechanism while using substantially less power — claiming that it is four times more energy efficient than Bitcoin.

It is described as a blend of unique technology and mathematically verified mechanisms, with behavioral psychology and economic philosophy thrown in for good measure. Overall, the objective of Ouroboros is to achieve sustainable and ethical growth.

An incentive mechanism means that participants in the network are rewarded for their involvement.

## What Is Cardano’s Alonzo Upgrade?

On Sept. 12, Cardano released its highly-anticipated Alonzo upgrade. Following the upgrade, the blockchain network can now support a wide range of crypto applications, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts.

According to the project’s founder Charles Hoskinson, Alonzo aims to introduce “programmability” to the network. He likened the upgrade to when JavaScript was introduced to web browsers and the transition from static web pages to the likes of Facebook and YouTube.

Alonzo is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church, who is considered to be one of the founding fathers of computer science.

In addition to supporting NFTs and smart contracts, Cardano can now be used for decentralized exchanges.

In general, Alonzo puts Cardano in the same class as Ethereum, the world’s leading blockchain which supports other applications other than its native Ether token. Smart contracts, for instance, are one of the cornerstones of the decentralized finance sector — and Cardano now supports smart contracts.

In February 2022, the number of Cardano wallets broke the three million milestone. Since December 2020, it has surged by 1,200%, from 190,000 to over 3,000,000. This coincided with an increase in smart contracts following the Alonzo Upgrade, and Cardano surpassed the 1,000 smart contracts milestone on Jan. 27, 2022. 

Another indicator of the ecosystem's explosive growth is developer activity: Cardano boasted the most developers contributing to its Github, beating out more developed blockchains like [Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/). On average, more than 50 contributions are submitted to its repo per day.

However, the network is still struggling with implementing its [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), and users had complaints about a sluggish launch of its [SundaeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sundaeswap/) decentralized exchange in January 2022.

It is the fastest, simplest, and easiest way to unleash the power of Decentralized Clouds for projects within the crypto space and beyond. By optimizing storage solutions with its AI-based pipeline, ColdStack provides users with the most cost-efficient and secure way to store their files. ColdStack approach is transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable. The platform provides simple and seamless integration of all the Decentralized Data Storages in one platform. There will also be no need for data migration needed to switch between various Decentralized Clouds.

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Coldstack](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-coldstack).

ColdStack features a unified Amazon S3 compatible API which allows users to easily access decentralized storage solutions. By utilizing the $CLS token, users gain access to nearly any decentralized storage, and are no longer required to research the particular strengths of each service in addition to comparing costs. With our implementation of Amazon S3 API compatibility, we also allow individuals to access these services through an interface they are already familiar with, further streamlining a user’s experience. Users can also access a wide range of file permissions and curate their experience based on their data storage needs. The unified API will create easy data storage and retrieval that will be possible from anywhere and anytime.

NFTs also add another layer of complexity and fragmentation to decentralized storages, as these must also be stored on their respective networks and marketplaces. The platform has NFT support allowing users to tokneize any uploaded file in ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards. As it currently stands, the ColdStack platform will be the only way a user can store bulk data with Filecoin, 4k photos with Storj, webpages with Arweave, and list NFTs with OpenSea and Rarible, all with one token.","{""website"":[""https://coldstack.io"",""https://dashboard.coldstack.io/""],""technical_doc"":[""https://coldstack.io/files/ColdStackLitePaper.pdf""],""explorer"":[""https://etherscan.io/token/0x675bbc7514013e2073db7a919f6e4cbef576de37"",""https://bscscan.com/token/0x668048e70284107a6afab1711f28d88df3e72948""],""source_code"":[],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/ColdStack"",""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/coldstack"",""https://medium.com/coldstack""],""chat"":[""https://t.me/coldstackio""],""announcement"":[""https://t.me/coldstack_ann""],""reddit"":[],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/coldstack_io""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1027.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x675bbc7514013e2073db7a919f6e4cbef576de37"",""ContractPlatform"":""Ethereum"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://etherscan.io/token/0x675bbc7514013e2073db7a919f6e4cbef576de37""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1839.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x668048e70284107a6afab1711f28d88df3e72948"",""ContractPlatform"":""BNB Smart Chain (BEP20)"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://bscscan.com/token/0x668048e70284107a6afab1711f28d88df3e72948""}]","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9022.png"",""Name"":""Trust Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.trustwallet.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9025.png"",""Name"":""MetaMask"",""URL"":""https://metamask.io/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9152.png"",""Name"":""Binance Chain Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/""}]","[{""Auditor"":""Hacken"",""ReportUrl"":""https://hacken.io/audits/coldstack""}]"

These are the three pillars on which we place user experience above all else.

Web3 gaming fundamentally changes the ownership structure of in-game assets; in traditional gaming, assets are stuck within the game you bought them for.  It also enables interesting new game mechanics, such as our “game-agnostic” NFTs, which are playable across multiple games within our ecosystem.

Unfortunately, current Web3 gaming initiatives are a disjointed mess of different networks, tokens, and “closed” platforms, often with a convoluted process that does not support mass adoption by the massive traditional gaming customer base ($300B annual market).  Additionally, existing networks are cost prohibitive and not scalable.

The OmniaVerse Web3 Entertainment Ecosystem solves all of this by addressing each of these individual problems while at the same time providing an easy to use and integrated platform.

$OMNIA is the native coin of our Apex blockchain and serves as the primary asset within our ecosystem, alongside $BLOCK, our in-game utility token.

The Sandbox,SAND,the-sandbox,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/6210.png,token,"To learn more about this project, check out our [deep dive into The Sandbox](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-the-sandbox).

## What Is The Sandbox (SAND)?

Launched in 2011 by Pixowl, The Sandbox is a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain)-based virtual world allowing users to create, build, buy and sell digital assets in the form of a game. By combining the powers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and [non-fungible tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-protect-your-nfts) ([NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token)), the Sandbox creates a decentralized platform for a thriving gaming community.

According to the [official whitepaper](https://installers.sandbox.game/The_Sandbox_Whitepaper_2020.pdf), the Sandbox platform’s main mission is to introduce blockchain technology in mainstream gaming successfully. The platform focuses on facilitating a creative “play-to-earn” model, which allows users to be both creators and gamers simultaneously. The Sandbox employs the powers of blockchain technology by introducing the SAND utility token, which facilitates transactions on the platform. 


### Who Are the Founders of The Sandbox?

[Arthur Madrid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurmadrid/) is co-founder and CEO at Pixowl, and he is one of the driving forces behind The Sandbox. He graduated with a degree in economics from Université Paris Dauphine in 2000. Madrid’s professional career began as a consultant for Eurogroup Consulting France, but he soon found his entrepreneurial spirit. In 2001, he founded 1-Click Media, which was later purchased by Ipercast. 

[Sebastien Borget](https://www.linkedin.com/in/borgetsebastien/) is also a co-founder at Pixowl and serves as the COO of the company. He graduated with a degree in computer systems networking and telecommunications from Institut national des Télécommunications in 2007. His professional career began as a project lead for 1-Click Media, and since then, Arthur Madrid and Sebastien Borget have been an entrepreneurial duo. They founded Pixowl in 2011 and have been continually working on projects together.

### The Sandbox Play-to-Earn Model

The dynamic game was developed according to the Play-to-Earn ([P2E](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/play-to-earn-play2earn)) business model. It allows players to participate in the in-game economy, contribute and receive benefits in the form of digital assets (cryptocurrencies and NFTs). Thus, players are constantly creating valuable items that can be sold on the marketplace. The game not only unleashes the creativity of users from all over the world but also empowers them to shape the universe with NFTs.

The Sandbox is building a decentralized digital platform for a growing gaming community, combining [Decentralized Autonomous Organizations](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) (DAO) and [non-fungible tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) (NFTs). In its universe, users can play the role of both creators and players.


### The Sandbox Products

The Sandbox metaverse consists of three products. Game Maker is a set of tools that allows users to create and test 3D games on their LAND using ASSETS. The program enables editing game elements, such as environments or characters, and NFTs without requiring advanced programming skills.

VoxEdit is a free software for platform users. The application has been developed for 3D voxel modeling and creation of NFTs. Voxels are 3D pixels that can be edited and shaped via Voxel Editor. The VoxEdit tool offers players to create avatar-oriented equipment, like clothes, weapons, pets. It is also used to generate items for interaction on The Sandbox platform. Virtual items can be monetized as NFTs, namely moved from VoxEdit to The Sandbox Marketplace, turned into ASSETS, and then sold. All transactions are implemented in $SAND.

The Sandbox Marketplace launched in the spring 2021. The platform is an NFT marketplace where players can upload, release and sell their NFT creations (ASSETS) with SAND tokens. The InterPlanetary File System ([IPFS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs)) is used to store all information about ASSETS.

#### What Makes The Sandbox Unique?

The Sandbox is a unique platform because it introduces blockchain technology to the world of gaming. The gaming industry is a huge untapped market when it comes to the adoption of blockchain tech, and Pixowl saw that in 2011. By creating a universe where gamers can create and collect blockchain-based assets, the Sandbox aims to revolutionizes the market. It makes a niche for itself in the global market of gaming. 

By focusing on user-generated content, the Sandbox creates a metaverse of involved players who contribute to the platform’s further development. Not only that, by introducing the SAND token, the Sandbox promotes decentralized governance and allows users to share their views and ideas about the development of the project. Thanks to the evolving technology, decentralized governance is becoming a must-have in blockchain-based projects.

The company started out with a bang and attracted support and investments from numerous big names in the gaming industry. These include brands like Atari, Helix and CryptoKitties.

### The Sandbox Native Tokens

The Sandbox has several types of native tokens for interacting with the platform. SAND is an in-game currency and an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, which means holders can store and earn rewards for holding. SAND is a utility token, therefore it is essential for the implementation and facilitation of all types of transactions on the platform. In addition, SAND is a governance token, its holders can vote for changes through the DAO. SAND tokens can be used to purchase virtual plots of land, engage with NFTs, as well as to receive privileges.

LAND is an NFT-type token, or digital real estate element, that uses an [ERC-721](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-721) non-fungible token standard issued on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). LAND allows users to monetize their gaming experience. Players can buy LAND for $SAND or $ETH through Public Sales, The Sandbox Marketplace, and other NFT platforms.

ASSETS are in-game objects, or NFTs, that are created by users themselves. Voxel models are made with VoxEdit and traded in The Sandbox Marketplace.

#### How Many The Sandbox (SAND) Coins Are There in Circulation?

There is a maximum and total supply of 3,000,000,000 SAND tokens. Currently, about 680,266,194 SAND tokens are in active circulation, which represents 23% of the total supply available as of March 2021.

Of the total token supply, about 25.82% was set aside in a company reserve. Another 17.18% were allocated for the seed sale of the token. The founders and team members secured about 31% of the total token supply distributed among them. Around 12% of the total supply were set aside for a dedicated Binance Launchpad Sale, and another 10% were dedicated as rewards to advisors on the project. 


### How Is The Sandbox Network Secured?

As the Sandbox virtual world is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, it is secured by the proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus mechanism. The SAND token is a standard version [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, which means owners can stake it and benefit from staking rewards. 

Unlike the proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) consensus mechanism employed by the Bitcoin blockchain, PoS does not require vast amounts of electrical or computing power to validate transactions. It relies on stakeholders with the largest holdings in SAND tokens. The PoS consensus mechanism allows for a lot of diverse applications while still ensuring the security of staked funds. 


### Where Can You Buy The Sandbox (SAND)?

The Sandbox is enjoying a rise in interest from both investors and users, and more exchanges have started offering trades with the SAND token. [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) has the largest trading volume of SAND/BUSD, with $7,015,941 processed in transactions so far as of March 2021.

Other options for buying SAND include [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/), [Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/), and [LATOKEN](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/latoken/).

Huobi Token,HT,htx-token,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2502.png,token,"## What Is Huobi Token (HT)?

[Huobi Token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/huobi-token/) (HT) is the native token of the cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global. It is a decentralized digital asset based on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain and is [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) compliant. HT’s value is in part reliant upon the reputation of the Huobi crypto exchange, yet other factors also have an impact.

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Huobi Token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-huobi-token-ht).

Huobi Token is a relatively young project. It first launched in January 2018, hot on the heels of the release of a native token on rival crypto exchange [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/). Having its own token allows Huobi to build a flexible marketing strategy in order to attract new users and further grow its platform.

One key function of the token is to reduce commissions for trading operations on the exchange, which are usually paid from users' wallets. Yet the token has much more to offer. Using HT, users can purchase monthly VIP-status plans to receive discounts on transaction fees. Token holders have the right to vote on exchange decisions, can receive crypto rewards for seasonal buybacks, and also get early access to special events. HT holders can, at any point, trade the token for other cryptocurrencies.


## Who Are the Founders of Huobi Token?

Leon Li is the founder and CEO of Huobi Group. Having graduated from Tsinghua University (Department of Automation), he became a proponent of [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) in 2011. Li began his career as a computer engineer at Oracle, the world's largest database provider. In 2013, he founded Huobi Group, took over the management of the company and transformed it into a leading global player in the provision of financial services in the field of digital assets.

Jun Du is Huobi’s co-founder. Prior to his role at Huobi, he was a community operations director at Comsenz and worked at Tencent. In addition, Du serves as CEO at Node Capital (a venture capital firm with a focus on the blockchain industry), is the founder of Jinse (a blockchain service platform integrating industry news, market information and data) and is co-CEO at BiKi.com (a software provider for digital currency trading). Lastly, he has co-founded companies that include AToken and Chainup.

In 2018, the founder of Crypto Chain University, Herbert Rafael Sim, joined the Huobi Group team. Sim has an impressive track record and has contributed to the development of Forbes, The Huffington Posts and Wardrobe Trends Fashion. At Huobi, Sim is responsible for digital marketing and serves as public relations director.


## What Makes Huobi Token (HT) Unique?

The [Huobi Token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/huobi-token/) has two main functions. First, the Huobi exchange uses HT for its loyalty program that rewards members with a range of discounts. The company has also decided to use HT tokens to confer voting rights on users of the Huobi Autonomous Digital Asset Exchange (HADAX). 

To fulfil these functions, Huobi has attempted to keep HT’s value reasonably stable. To curb inflation, the company allocates 20% of profits for a token buyback program.

HT token holders have several advantages thanks to the token’s circulation, which include:

**Reduced transaction fees. **The Huobi exchange offers a series of discounts for clients with VIP status. With this option, investors and traders can save a decent amount of funds on commissions.

**Convenient means of exchange.** The platform does its best to make it easy and convenient to exchange Huobi Token and supports the asset as part of trading pairs with numerous popular cryptocurrencies.

**Promotion of new tokens**. HT holders receive coins with each listing of new crypto assets and also can also receive a wallet bonus.

**Investor Protection Program.** The tokens bought out by the exchange are sent to an investor protection fund, whose purpose is to compensate for any financial losses.

**Participation in decision making.** HT token holders can vote and thereby influence the development of the Huobi exchange and its wider ecosystem.

## How Many Huobi Token (HT) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The launch of [Huobi Token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/huobi-token/) took place at the beginning of 2018 and did not proceed according to the standard [ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) scheme. To begin with, Huobi distributed HT tokens directly to VIP users and regular traders could buy a package of services with a certain amount of tokens. As distinct from an ICO, this method of distributing coins is called an initial exchange offering ([IEO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-exchange-offering)).

Huobi Token has a limited total supply of 500 million. After its launch, 60% (300 million coins) were allocated among the users of the exchange and the company kept aside 40% (200 million coins) in reserve.

The decision to create its own token led to an increase in the exchange’s capitalization. The token also helped to encourage users to remain loyal to the platform by offering them exclusive advantages through its various functions.


## How Is the Huobi Token Network Secured?

The Huobi ecosystem uses a distributed architecture and anti-DDoS protection system to bolster security. In addition, 98% of the currency is stored in a multisig cold wallet. The exchange also uses a risk control system dubbed “Don’t Be Evil” to ensure the safety of users’ accounts and assets.

Since 2018, the platform has used an asset protection system called the Security Reservation Mechanism. In parallel, Huobi also launched its Investor Protection Fund in January of that year. Thanks to these measures, HT holders are insured against financial losses that may arise as a result of fraudulent activities or other risks associated with cryptocurrency trading.


## Where Can You Buy Huobi Token (HT)?

The easiest way to acquire [Huobi Token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/huobi-token/) is to purchase it on [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/). The exchange supports a large number of token trading pairs and offers advantageous trading rates. Aside from this option, HT is supported on multiple exchanges, including: [Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/), [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/), [Binance JEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance-jex/), [AscendEX (Bitmax)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/ascendex/), [LBank](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/lbank/), [ProBit Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/probit-exchange/), [0x Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/0x-protocol/), [Bit Well](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitwell/), [XT.COM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/xt/), [Wootrade](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/wootrade/), [CoinEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinex/), [ACE](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/ace/), [BitMart](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitmart/), [Xtheta Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/xtheta-global/), [BitZ](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitz/), [BiKi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/biki/), [BiONE](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bione/), [Bitay](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitay/), [Pionex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pionex/), [Hoo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hoo/), [YunEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/yunex/), [BKEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bkex/), [ZBG](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/zbg/), [Bibox](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bibox/), [Hotbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotbit/), [MEXC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/), [BitForex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitforex/https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitforex/), [HitBTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hitbtc/), [Finexbox](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/finexbox/), [Switcheo Network](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/switcheo/), [Hotcoin Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hotcoin-global/), [Tokenlon](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/tokenlon/), [Dsdaq](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/dsdaq/), [Bgogo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bgogo/), [Anyswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/anyswap/), [NUT MONEY](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/nut-money/).

Shiba Inu,SHIB,shiba-inu,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5994.png,token,"## What Is SHIBA INU (SHIB)?

SHIB is the main token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, bringing the power of a decentralized, community-led currency to millions across the globe. Since its inception in late 2020, the Ethereum-based SHIB token has grown to become a worldwide phenomenon, and is now accepted as a form of payment at hundreds of locations, either directly or through third-party intermediaries.

Shiba Inu coin was created anonymously in August 2020 under the pseudonym ""Ryoshi."" Ryoshi says about himself that he is a nobody and not important and that the efforts to unmask his identity, even if successful, would be underwhelming.

This [meme coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/memecoin) quickly gained speed and value as a community of investors was drawn in by the cute charm of the coin paired with headlines and tweets from personalities like Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik Buterin was long believed to be the originator of Shiba Inu, but denied such rumors on the Lex Fridman podcast on June 5, 2021. 

Since release SHIB now trades on the ecosystem's proprietary DEX, [ShibaSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/shibaswap/).

On Sept. 17, 2021, [Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/), the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, listed Shiba Inu on their platform. This news caused Shiba Inu price to rise by over 40% in the following two days, bringing the meme dog token into the spotlight again.



### Who Are the Founders of SHIBA INU?

The SHIBA INU WoofPaper has three reasons why their team created SHIB:

1. ""We started from zero, with zero.""
2. ""The brilliant minds behind Shib had never collaborated before.""
3. ""We love Shiba Inu Dogs.""

The anonymous creator of the Shiba Inu coin is known as ""Ryoshi."" However, very little is known of the mystery founder of the dog-themed cryptocurrency, much like the founder of Bitcoin, [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/satoshi-nakamoto).

In his blog RYOSHI RESEARCH, he characterizes himself as ""just some guy of no consequence tapping at a keyboard."" Ryoshi said that usually in projects there are different roles like a CEO, a ""tech guy,"" and a roadmap, resulting in ""someone plebs can bitch at."" He stresses that with Shiba, no one person is accountable or responsible and underlines that he owns 0 SHIB to this day. For this reason, Ryoshi can be ""pure and unbiased,"" getting satisfaction from Shiba ""in other ways.""

It has been speculated that Vitalik Buterin was behind the initial liquidity that helped set up Shiba Inu's liquidity on Uniswap. According to Ryoshi, he had ""a fren"" he met at Devcon in Osaka that sent him 10 ETH to set up the liquidity pair on Uniswap. Ryoshi also stated that Shiba Inu was an experiment in decentralized community building, and he thus declined all the influencer requests and pitches from different exchanges he received. His ""job"" is to defend the brand and give suggestions, although he does so very sparingly, as his last blog entry dates back to May 2021.


### What Makes SHIBA INU Unique?

The SHIBA INU website invites dog-inspired artists from all over the world to foster the ""artistic Shiba movement"" as they bring their SHIBA INU community into the [NFT market](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-protect-your-nfts). SHIBA INU has also created a campaign using Amazon Smile in order to collect donations to escue real, live Shiba Inu dogs with the Shiba Inu Rescue Association.

After initially being only one meme coin of many, Shiba Inu skyrocketed to popularity after Vitalik Buterin famously burned his share of the SHIB supply. Ryoshi had given Buterin 50% of the SHIB supply, announcing that ""as long as Vitalik doesn't rug us,"" Shiba Inu would be fine. 

However, Buterin decided to burn 90% of his share, which later would have been worth billions thanks to the soaring value of SHIB. The remaining 10% were sent to a charity, as were about 50 trillion SHIB more that Vitalik had donated to a COVID-19 relief fund. He stated that he did not want ""to be a locus of power"" and thus gave the tokens away. This resulted in a temporary loss of value for SHIB, which the token later recovered from after the community agreed on an arrangement with the charity in question. 

Ryoshi's goal for Shiba Inu has been to see if a perpetual decentralized organization could work with no central leadership. In a blog post, Royshi noted that the rift caused by Buterin's token donation made the community stronger and would enable it to distribute further and decentralize the movement. His vision for the core ecosystem is to perform its utility while the Shiba Inu-own stablecoin becomes the globalized exchange of value. 

In October 2021, SHIB surged on the news of a possible Robinhood listing and briefly flipped Dogecoin to become the most-valued meme coin by market capitalization. Thus far, Robinhood has not listed SHIB, despite a petition with over 500,000 signatures calling for it. Robinhood executive Christine Brown has lauded the efforts of the Shiba Inu community, saying that one of her favorite things was seeing it engage with the community to make its wishes heard. However, Robinhood would prioritize safety over the ""short-term gain"" of a new token listing and has left Shiba Inu fans waiting since.

The October 2021 price surge famously minted a billionaire, as one wallet was uncovered that had bought $8,000 worth of SHIB in summer 2020, which was worth over $5.7 billion at SHIB's all-time high valuation. The wallet owner has not been determined, although the person appears to have sent parts of their fortune to other wallets several weeks after the price explosion. 

The price surge also led to increased adoption across token holders. WhaleStats compiled data of the largest ETH wallets and found that SHIB represents over 20% of the combined market shares of all [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) tokens held by Ethereum whales. [CRO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crypto-com-coin/) was a distant second with only 5%. SHIB also surpassed the one-million holder mark following its all-time high.

Moreover, retailers increasingly started adopting SHIB as a means of payment following its popularity among small-time investors. American electronics retailer Newegg added SHIB at the start of December 2021, partnering with crypto payments platform BitPay to unlock payments in SHIB. This followed the adoption of SHIB by over 500 merchants, according to payments firm CoinGate, with even Samsung-backed digital wallet provider ZenGo adding SHIB to its options and a [restaurant in Paris ](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/shiba-inu-accepted-at-restaurant-in-paris)accepting it as a payment option. At one point, the Shiba Inu community called for McDonald's to accept Shiba Inu, although the social media effort eventually fell short.

A major reason for the surging price of SHIB was a continued effort by the SHIB community to build a utility for the Shiba Inu token and the subsequent emergence of an entire Shiba Inu ecosystem.

ShibaSwap is the coin's designated DEX that started as a fork of [Sushiswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/) that has, in the words of Ryoshi, its ""own little twists and elements."" Furthermore, Shiba Inu also plans to develop SHI, which will be the ""global exchange of value for plebs,"" an [algorithmic stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/algorithmic-stablecoin) pegged to one cent instead of one dollar as most other stablecoins. Its launch is planned after the Shiba [layer-two](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) solution called Shibarium, and Ryoshi envisions SHI to work in a similar way to [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/). That way, SHI would have collateral as a backstop that would push it back to one cent if the peg was lost. 

According to Ryoshi, the end goal is that SHI becomes a global stable currency ""that plebs across all countries are able to use as both a store of value and method of payment."" 

In addition to SHI, a financial ecosystem is planned, and SHI would be added as a weighted pool pair on [Curve](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/). In that case, Ryoshi expects forks of the major DeFi protocols to appear in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which would require an immutable bridge to function.

Shiba would also start hosting localized meetups and a once-a-year ShibaCon convention that would be hosted at an easily accessible location in a country without oppressive visa restrictions ""for the sake of inclusiveness for global plebs."" 

One immediate change Shiba Inu has implemented is increasing token burns, which have sparked renewed interest in the token at the beginning of 2022. Bigger Entertainment, a crypto record label selling merch, [NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mint-an-nft) and concert tickets, organized a SHIB burn party that burned over 239 million SHIB over Christmas. In total, the team has burned almost one billion SHIB since the end of October.

## SHIB: The Metaverse and Shibarium

While looking to expand the utility of SHIB, the development team introduced a [metaverse](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/metaverse) — a virtual reality project powered by [non-fungible tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) (NFTs). Here, users can mint parcels of digital lands using [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) or its equivalent amount in SHIB tokens. Interestingly, other Shiba Inu-related tokens – [BONE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bone-shibaswap/) and [LEASH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/doge-killer/) – will also play various roles as different phases of the metaverse come to life.

According to the team, the goal is to create a fun, immersive and interactive environment where users can explore, earn passive income and collect in-game resources. Importantly, the metaverse will allow users to develop and launch their own projects. In total, there are 100,595 plots of land on SHIB: The Metaverse. Of the total, 36,431 digital lands were unlocked on April 13, 2022 – the launch date of the introductory phase of the metaverse. 

Like most existing metaverses, the parcels of lands found on SHIB: The Metaverse are categorized based on the desirability of their locations. Naturally, lands in strategic areas are valued higher than the rest. The four tiers of lands on Shiba's metaverse are as follows:

* Tier 4: Silver Fur: 17,030 Lands
* Tier 3: Gold Tail: 7,356 Lands
* Tier 2: Platinum Paw: 5,714 Lands
* Tier 1: Diamond Teeth: 2,024 Lands

Below were the launch prices of the tiers listed above: 

* 0.2 $ETH for (Tier 4) Silver Fur
* 0.3 $ETH for (Tier 3) Gold Tail
* 0.5 $ETH for (Tier 2) Platinum Paw
* 1 $ETH for (Tier 1) Diamond Teeth

Originally, the plan was to allow the use of ETH alone to mint unlocked lands. However, the team later decided to add the SHIB token as a minting currency, thereby expanding the utility of the token.

Although users have begun to purchase SHIB lands, the SHIB metaverse will not officially launch until Shibarium, an upcoming layer 2 scaling network that will eventually house the entire Shiba ecosystem, is deployed. The plan is to have a layer 2 ecosystem built on top of Ethereum's layer 1 network to meet the computational and memory demands for running the fast-expanding Shiba ecosystem. Apart from hosting the SHIB metaverse on Shibarium, the team is also looking to deploy a [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin), called SHI, on the layer 2 solution. 

Another notable development that coincided with the introduction of SHIB: The Metaverse was the launch of a new website where future developments and expansions, including the launch of the metaverse, will take place. 


#### How Many SHIBA INU (SHIB) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The SHIBA INU website notes that they locked 50% of the total token supply on Uniswap, and ""threw away the keys!"" The remaining 50% was ""burned to Vitalik Buterin."" In response to the ""gift"" from the Shiba Inu team, Vitalik Buterin sent 50 trillion SHIB tokens, worth $1 billion in Shiba Inu price at that time, to India's Covid Crypto Relief Fund. Buterin then [burned](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/burned) 40% of the total supply to a dead wallet.

There are several other tokens described on the SHIBA INU website — LEASH, which has ""been unleashed and will not rebase,"" and BONE, the ""Dogecoin Killer."" LEASH has a fixed supply of only 107,646 tokens, and offers enticing rewards to [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider), while BONE has 250,000,000 tokens, and is a [governance token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token) that allows holders to vote on the Shiba Inu's Doggy [decentralized autonomous organization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) (DAO).

The WoofPaper notes that you will use SHIB to DIG for BONES or ShibaSwap, or even BURY your tokens. ""Trainers"" can teach their Shibas to SWAP tokens as well — all of these actions create ""Returns"" that are put into the Puppy Pools, where the #SHIBARMY has the option of BURYING or DIGGING for BONES.

At the beginning of May 2021, dog-themed meme tokens like Shiba Inu [saw transaction volumes](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-fees-hit-aths-amid-uncanny-dog-token-frenzy-a-data-perspective-by-intotheblock) in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Shiba Inu price hit an [all-time high](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/all-time-high) (ATH) of 0.00005 on May 10, 2021, before going on a downtrend since.

As mentioned above, on May 13, Vitalik Buterin (who was given half of the token supply by the developers) [announced](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/the-surprising-reason-shiba-inu-has-plunged-44-in-24-hours) that he was donating a large amount of these tokens to a fund helping India with COVID relief. The SHIBA developers had not anticipated Buterin selling his tokens, but eventually, the two parties came to a mutually satisfying agreement. Later, [the fund actually lamented having sold its tokens too early](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/covid-fund-lost-1-2b-by-selling-shib-too-early), as its share would have been worth well over $1 billion at the token's all-time high. 

Despite rumors alleging the contrary, [Elon Musk](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/shib-crashes-as-musk-reveals-which-coins-he-owns) does not own any SHIB. He confirmed as much in a tweet, which caused a temporary price drop.


### How Is the SHIBA INU Network Secured?

According to 22-page-long SHIB's WoofPaper, SHIB is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token based on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), a proof-of-work blockchain currently transitioning to proof-of-stake.

Ryoshi announced in his final blog post to date that Shiba Inu would develop its own layer-two solution that would be more decentralized than  [Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/) or [BSC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin/), both of which Ryoshi regards as not truly decentralized. The Shiba L2 would be called ""Shibarium"" and is supposed to use BONE as its primary pair token, as written above.

According to Ryoshi, Shibarium would be built by a ""very competent blockchain team"" with experience building such solutions. Developer Eric M has announced in the Shiba Inu Discord server that Shibarium would launch ""soon,"" although he did not specify a date.

Solana,SOL,solana,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5426.png,coin,"## What Is Solana (SOL)?

Solana is a highly functional open source project that banks on blockchain technology’s permissionless nature to provide decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi)) solutions. While the idea and initial work on the project began in 2017, Solana was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/solana).

The Solana protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app ([DApp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus of the blockchain.

Because of the innovative hybrid consensus model, Solana enjoys interest from small-time traders and institutional traders alike. A significant focus for the Solana Foundation is to make decentralized finance accessible on a larger scale.


### Who Are the Founders of Solana?

[Anatoly Yakovenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anatoly-yakovenko/) is the most important person behind Solana. His professional career started at Qualcomm, where he quickly moved up the ranks and became senior staff engineer manager in 2015. Later on, his professional path shifted, and Yakovenko entered a new position as a software engineer at Dropbox.

In 2017, Yakovenko started working on a project which would later materialize as Solana. He teamed up with his Qualcomm colleague [Greg Fitzgerald](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregoryrfitzgerald/), and they founded a project called Solana Labs. Attracting several more former Qualcomm colleagues in the process, the Solana protocol and SOL token were released to the public in 2020.


#### What Makes Solana Unique?

One of the essential innovations Solana brings to the table is the proof-of-history (PoH) consensus developed by Anatoly Yakovenko. This concept allows for greater scalability of the protocol, which in turn boosts usability.

Solana is known in the cryptocurrency space because of the incredibly short processing times the blockchain offers. Solana’s hybrid protocol allows for significantly decreased validation times for both transaction and smart contract execution. With lightning-fast processing times, Solana has attracted a lot of institutional interest as well.

The Solana protocol is intended to serve both small-time users and enterprise customers alike. One of Solana’s main promises to customers is that they will not be surprised by increased fees and taxes. The protocol is designed in such a way as to have low transaction costs while still guaranteeing scalability and fast processing.

Combined with the longstanding professional expertise creators Anatoly Yakovenko and Greg Fitzgerald bring to the project, Solana is ranked number 7 in the CoinMarketCap [ranking](https://coinmarketcap.com/) as of September 2021.

This came on the back of an impressive bull run, where Solana price gained over 700% since mid-July 2021. The launch of the Degenerate Ape [NFT collection](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mint-an-nft) sent SOL price to an [all-time high](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/all-time-high) (ATH) above $60, and it has been climbing since, largely due to higher developer activity on the Solana ecosystem, greater institutional interest, growing DeFi ecosystem, and the [rise of the NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-protect-your-nfts) and gaming vertical on Solana. Solana price rose to an ATH of $216 on Sept. 9, 2021.

Solana has received much praise for its speed and performance, and has even been tipped as a rival that can [compare to Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/solana-vs-ethereum-a-detailed-comparison) and challenge the dominant smart contract platform. However, the network has been plagued by repeated [outages](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/solana-fastest-blockchain-in-world-hit-by-attack) that have impaired its price and aspirations to be the ""[Visa of crypto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/solana-can-be-visa-of-crypto-bank-of-america-says)."" Furthermore, its [ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-solana-a-guide-to-solana-s-ecosystem-projects) is accused of favoring venture capital investors with unfair tokenomics.

#### How Many Solana (SOL) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The Solana Foundation has announced that a total of 489 million SOL tokens will be released in circulation. At the moment, about 260 million of these have already entered the market.

The SOL token distribution is as follows: 16.23% went towards an initial seed sale, 12.92% of tokens were dedicated to a founding sale, 12.79% of SOL coins were distributed among team members and 10.46% of tokens were given to the Solana Foundation. The remaining tokens were already released for public and private sales or are still to be released to the market.

Solana price during the initial seed sale, held on April 5, 2018, was $0.04. Given the recent ATH, that represents an impressive 5400X [return on investment](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/roi) (ROI).


### How Is the Solana Network Secured?

Solana relies on a unique combination of proof-of-history (PoH) and proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus mechanisms.

Proof-of-history is the main component of the Solana protocol, as it is responsible for the bulk of transaction processing. PoH records successful operations and the time that has passed between them, thus ensuring the trustless nature of the blockchain.

The proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus is used as a monitoring tool for the PoH processes, and it validates each sequence of blocks produced by it.

The combination of two consensus mechanisms makes Solana a unique phenomenon in the blockchain industry.


### Where Can You Buy Solana (SOL)?

SOL tokens can be purchased on most exchanges. One choice to trade Solana is on [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), as it has the highest SOL/USDT trading volume, $753,103,225 as of September 2021.

Uniswap,UNI,uniswap,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/7083.png,token,"## What Is Uniswap (UNI)?

[Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) is a popular decentralized trading protocol, known for its role in facilitating automated trading of decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) tokens.

An example of an automated market maker ([AMM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)), Uniswap launched in November 2018, but has gained considerable popularity this year thanks to the DeFi phenomenon and associated surge in token trading.

Uniswap aims to keep token trading automated and completely open to anyone who holds tokens, while improving the efficiency of trading versus that on traditional exchanges.

Uniswap creates more efficiency by solving liquidity issues with automated solutions, avoiding the problems which plagued the first [decentralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/top-decentralized-exchanges-dex).

In September 2020, Uniswap went a step further by creating and awarding its own [governance token](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token), UNI, to past users of the protocol. This added both profitability potential and the ability for users to shape its future — an attractive aspect of decentralized entities.


## Who Are the Founders of Uniswap?

Uniswap came about as a plan to introduce AMMs on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) to a wider audience. The platform’s creator is Ethereum developer Hayden Adams.

Adams worked in various projects while finalizing Uniswap, and his work was informed directly by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin even ended up giving the protocol its name — it was originally known as Unipeg.

Adams has also said that the original inspiration for the [Uniswap platform](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-uniswap) came from one of Buterin’s own blog posts. His original idea to focus on Ethereum came after a friend convinced him to begin researching and understanding the protocol in 2017.

### Uniswap DAO

The Uniswap DAO has over 310,000 members that can vote over the $1.6B treasury, [governance](https://gov.uniswap.org/) and roadmap of the [DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/top-decentralized-exchanges-dex) by holding UNI [governance tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance-token). Any UNI holders can submit a proposal, however it must garner up to 25,000 yes-votes before it can be eligible for further deliberation. The next phase is the consensus check, where the proposer has to highlight the core changes and garner at least 50,000 yes-votes. Finally, the governance phase has to attract 40M yes-votes for the proposal to be adopted. Uniswap was the most dominant DEX in 2021 in terms of trading volume, and the top ranked DAO in terms of the amount held in the treasury. However, it is currently ranked second, behind [BitDAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitdao/) — a DAO focused on funding and investing in emerging crypto projects. Check out our [deep dive on Uniswap DAO and other top DAOs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-how-the-top-daos-work) and how their governance systems work.

### What Makes Uniswap Unique?

Uniswap exists to create liquidity — and therefore trading and the value that trading provides — for the DeFi sphere.

One of the major AMMs in operation at present, the protocol functions using a formula for automated exchange — X x Y = K. Founder Hayden Adams describes himself as the inventor of the particular implementation of the formula on Uniswap.

Uniswap is not just a decentralized exchange; it attempts to solve the issues that platforms such as [EtherDelta](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/etherdelta/) experienced with liquidity.

By automating the process of market making, the protocol inceventizes activity by limiting risk and reducing costs for all parties. The mechanism also removes identity requirements for users, and technically anyone can create a [liquidity pool](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-liquidity-pool-lp-tokens) for any pair of tokens.

According to Uniswap, their governance token (UNI) was created in order to “officially enshrin[e] Uniswap as publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities.”

Uniswap V2 launched on Nov. 2, 2018, and introduced new features like ERC-20 pairs, price [oracles](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/oracles), flash swaps and more. The latest version — Uniswap V3, launched on the mainnet on May 5, 2021. It features greater capital efficiency for [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider), better execution for traders and enhanced infrastructure. Uniswap price reached an [all-time high](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/all-time-high) (ATH) of $44.97 leading up to the mainnet launch of V3. Since it’s launch there has been substantial interest in it’s [UNI to AUD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/uni/aud/) and [UNI to EUR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/uni/eur/) price pairs.

## Uniswap Acquires NFT Aggregator Genie

Uniswap are preparing to take the next step in their journey to become a one-stop shop. The recent acquisition of NFT aggregator and marketplace Genie — through Uniswap Labs — aims to help the exchange's users unlock universal ownership. Integrating non-fungible tokens into the Uniswap product line could be seen as an intriguing development. Users will see this feature roll out in the web application, with developer APIs and widgets to follow later.

Genie is an NFT marketplace aggregator helping users discover, buy and sell [non-fungible tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) (NFTs) across multiple marketplaces. Additionally, users can buy NFTs across multiple marketplaces through one transaction, significantly reducing their gas fees. 

There are plans of Uniswap to offer a [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) airdrop to early adopters of the Genie platform, slated to take place in August 2022. Any user who used Genie at least once — or owned a Genie Genesis NFT by April 15 — should be eligible for this upcoming airdrop. This airdrop will last for 12 months, giving eligible users ample time to claim their rewards.

Furthermore, the Genie platform will remain accessible to users until the Uniswap NFT experience rolls out. Uniswap's team acknowledges that NFTs remain an ""important web3 gateway"" for crypto enthusiasts and mainstream users. Applying their DeFi knowledge to NFTs can potentially help bring digital ownership and value to a bigger audience.

It is not Uniswap's first venture into the NFT space, either. In 2019, the team launched the limited-edition Unisocks collection, providing NFT liquidity pools backed by real-world assets. Additionally, Uniswap Labs continues to work on Uniswap v3 NFT positions to further advance on-chain generative SVGs.

### **How Many Uniswap (UNI) Coins Are There In Circulation?**

The total supply of Uniswap’s governance token, UNI, is 1 billion units. These will become available over the course of four years, after which Uniswap will introduce a “perpetual inflation rate” of 2% to maintain network participation.

Token distribution currently consists of the following: 60% to Uniswap community members, i.e. users, 21.51% to team members, 17.8% to investors and 0.69% to advisors. The latter three distributions will occur according to a four-year vesting schedule.

Out of the majority set to go to users, 15% can be claimed by those who used Uniswap prior to Sep. 1, 2020. These even include users who submitted transactions which were never successful — they are eligible for 400 UNI.

The UNI token serves the purpose of enabling shared community ownership in the growth and development of the decentralized protocol. This allows UNI holders to participate in the governance of the Uniswap protocol and wider ecosystem, in a neutral and trustless manner. The success and adoption of Uniswap products will positively impact Uniswap price, hence incentivizing token holders to contribute to the self-sustaining development of the ecosystem.

Four years after the UNI token launch, in September 2024, a perpetual inflation rate of 2% annually will take effect. This is to ensure that participation in the Uniswap ecosystem continues, by disincentivizing passive holders.


### **How Is the Uniswap Network Secured?**

Uniswap is a decentralized protocol for trading, and UNI is its in-house governance token. UNI is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, meaning it requires Ethereum to function.

ERC-20 merely defines a set of rules for tokens, as well as security considerations mainly related to the strength of the Ethereum network. For example, congestion can hike the price of [gas](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/gas-price) needed to perform transactions, leading to delays and abnormally high transaction fees, which impact all participants.

Separately, [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) can cause security issues that could lead to DeFi traders losing funds; in fact, hackers have already succeeded in stealing millions of dollars in DeFi’s short lifetime as of September 2021.


### Where Can You Buy Uniswap (UNI)?

Uniswap’s UNI governance token is available for trading on major exchanges against other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fiat currencies and more.

These include [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) and [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/), along with, naturally, Uniswap’s protocol itself — [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) and [Uniswap (V3)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v3/).

eCash,XEC,ecash,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/10791.png,coin,"## What Is eCash (XEC)?

[eCash](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ecash/) (XEC) is the rebranded version of [Bitcoin Cash ABC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash-abc-2/) (BCHA), itself a [fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fork-blockchain) of [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC) and [Bitcoin Cash](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/) (BCH). It calls itself a “[cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) that’s designed to be used as electronic cash.” eCash strictly aims to be a means of transaction used to pay for goods and services. The coin was rebranded on July 1, 2021, and has since tried to distinguish itself from its predecessor. The base units of eCash are called “bits” and replace the unwieldy decimal places of Bitcoin Cash ABC. Instead of sending 0.00001000 BTC, you would send 10 bits with eCash. ECash integrates a [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) (PoS) [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) layer called “Avalanche,” which is not to be mistaken for the blockchain [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/) (AVAX). Upon rebranding, eCash announced that it would convert all BCHA coins to XEC at a ratio of one to one million. 

The cryptocurrency’s developers have set their sights on three main improvements:



* Scaling transaction [throughput](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/throughput) from 100 transactions per second to more than five million transactions per second
* Improving the payment experience by reducing transaction finality time
* Extending the protocol and establishing fork-free upgrades


## Who Are the Founders of eCash?

[eCash](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ecash/) (XEC) is led by its lead developer Amaury Sechet, who was the lead developer of [Bitcoin Cash](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/) (BCH) and forked that [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) to establish the predecessor of eCash, [Bitcoin Cash ABC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash-abc-2/) (BCHA). That fork happened on November 15, 2020. Sechet then decided to rebrand Bitcoin Cash ABC to establish a new brand identity for eCash, explaining that a reduction of decimal places would help with the adoption of the coin:

“No other money has eight decimal places. Why should crypto? Cryptocurrencies with a lower unit price also enjoy higher bull market appreciation. Because the eCash team is incentivized by both tech and price improvement, this improvement was a no-brainer.”

Sechet was highly active in the development of Bitcoin Cash, leading its initial fork away from Bitcoin in August 2017, its continuation after [Bitcoin SV](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-sv/) (BSV) was forked from it in November 2018, and its most recent fork from Bitcoin Cash in November 2020. Before his involvement in cryptocurrencies, he was a software engineer at Facebook and a lead developer at Stupid D Compiler.


## What Makes eCash Unique?

The developers of [eCash](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ecash/) (XEC) intend the coin to support [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) (EVM)-compatibility and to be interoperable with the [decentralized finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) (DeFi) sector on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (ETH). For the coin to become successful, eCash’s developers intend to fulfill five core missions:



* Ensuring anonymous transactions
* Ensuring the immutability of transactions
* Guaranteeing that transactions remain almost free
* Enforcing globally secure transactions with a finality of fewer than three seconds
* Designing the coin’s infrastructure as a public good, funded via its social contract

To achieve this, the developers of eCash have laid out an ambitious roadmap, with plans to have:



* Canonical transaction ordering to enable scalable block processing
* Schnorr Signatures to enable batched signature validation
* Faster block propagation through graphene or other
* UTXO commitment with blockchain pruning and faster initial sync
* Merklix-Meta Tree to enable scalable block processing
* Adaptive block sizes to support market-driven growth to 1TB blocks

These highly ambitious solutions would propel eCash to 50 transactions per user per day for up to 10 billion users.

## How Many eCash (XEC) Coins Are There in Circulation?

There is no [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/tokenomics) of [eCash](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ecash/) (XEC) but it follows many of the same rules already established for [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC). It shares Bitcoin’s supply and distribution model, meaning that every 210,000 [blocks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/block), approximately every four years, [miner](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/miners) rewards are cut in half. ECash has the same supply cap as Bitcoin of 2.1 quadrillion [satoshis](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/satoshi-sats), yet instead of those 2.1 quadrillion SATS being divided by 100 million to yield 21 million BTC, it was divided by 100, yielding 21 trillion XEC. The reason for this is simply that it is easier for users to mentally grasp integers and this decision aligns with the coin’s goal of mass adoption.


## How Is the eCash Network Secured?

In contrast to the [Bitcoin Cash ABC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash-abc-2/) (BCHA) network, which is secured using a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoW) [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism), the developers of eCash plan to add proof-of-stake (PoS) in order to speed up transactions. What they term “Avalanche post-consensus” would see enhanced security and fork-free upgrades and allow for advanced opcodes thanks to enhanced script capability. The Avalanche layer will be added on top of the existing PoW in order to leverage the benefits of both.

XEC is not an ERC-20 token, it is its own blockchain similar to Bitcoin (BTC).

## Where Can You Buy eCash (XEC)?

[eCash](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ecash/) (XEC) is available for purchase via [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/), [Mandala Exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mandala/) and [Upbit](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/upbit/).

Harmony,ONE,harmony,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3945.png,coin,"## What Is Harmony (ONE)?

Harmony is a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) platform designed to facilitate the creation and use of decentralized applications (DApps). The network aims to innovate the way decentralized applications work by focusing on random state sharding, which allows creating blocks in seconds.

According to the project’s website, Harmony is expected to introduce cross-shard contracts and a cross-chain infrastructure by the end of 2021.


## Who Are the Founders of Harmony?

[Stephen Tse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tsestephen/) is the founder and CEO of Harmony. He has a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, specializing in cryptographic protocols and type theory.

While finishing his degree, Dr. Tse became a research intern at Microsoft. In 2006 he started working as a senior engineer at Google, spending four years in the company. In 2011 he founded Spotsetter, a successful search engine which Apple later acquired. In 2014, Dr. Tse became the principal engineer for Apple. 

He founded Harmony in 2017. The Harmony founding team comprises twelve people, with seven of them being former employees at Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.


## What Makes Harmony Unique?

Focusing on processing speed and validation, the Harmony mainnet aims to revolutionize block creation. By introducing the sharding process, the company reduced node validation times significantly. 

To ensure the protection of nodes and secure the validation process, Harmony introduced the Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for unbiased and unpredictable shard membership. This means that nodes and validators are assigned and re-assigned in a randomized manner. 

The project’s Harmony Grants program is an initiative that aims to support innovation and attract developers to the Harmony mainnet.

## Harmony’s Horizon Bridge Hack

Like most cross-chain bridges, Harmony’s Horizon bridge allows crypto holders to move assets between Harmony's network and the Ethereum network, Binance Chain and Bitcoin. In June 2022, the bridge was exploited for approximately $100 million in altcoins (which the attacker swapped for Ethereum) after two of its five validator nodes were compromised.

Although the Harmony team offered a $1 million reward for information leading to the return of the stolen funds, security experts discovered that the attacker(s) had begun moving the loot through the now-defunct Ethereum mixing service, Tornado Cash. There were also reports that the hack was linked to Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korea-affiliated cybercriminal organization.

Interestingly, it appears all hope has not been lost. In January 2023, Binance and Huobi crypto exchanges teamed up to recover some of the stolen funds.

On January 16, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) said in a tweet: “_We detected Harmony One hacker fund movement. They previously tried to launder through Binance, and we froze his accounts. This time he used Huobi. We assisted Huobi’s team in freezing his accounts. Together, 124 BTC have been recovered. CeFi helping to keep DeFi SAFU._”

## How Many Harmony (ONE) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Harmony (ONE) has a maximum supply of 12,600,000,000 tokens. As of February 2021, the circulating supply on the market is about 9,486,327,268 ONE. 

Out of the total supply of ONE tokens, 22.4% were dedicated to the initial seed sale. Another 12.5% were set aside for an additional Launchpad sale. The Harmony founding team and developers received 16.9% of the total supply. About 26.4% of ONE tokens were dedicated to protocol development, while another 21.8% were directed towards ecosystem development.


## How Is the Harmony Network Secured?

Harmony introduces a new version of the proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus. Called effective proof-of-stake (EPoS), this method allows simultaneous staking from hundreds of validators. This consensus method was developed in accordance with the sharding concept utilized in the Harmony network. 

Unlike proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) consensus mechanisms, EPoS is designed for faster processing times and improved scalability. While PoW requires a lot of electrical and computing power, staking consensus methods rely on an abundance of value holders, who become validators. 

Harmony is also looking to boost staking incentives to attract more node operators. The Harmony Open Staking initiative encourages interaction with the network and incentivizes stakeholders with the highest amount of ONE tokens. 


## Where Can You Buy Harmony (ONE)?

Harmony (ONE) tokens can be purchased on most big exchanges, such as:



*   [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) 
*   [MXC.COM](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/mxc/)

Klaytn,KLAY,klaytn,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/4256.png,coin,"## What is Klaytn?
Developed by leading Korean IT company Kakao, Klaytn is a global Layer 1 public blockchain designed to power tomorrow’s on-chain world. With the lowest transaction latency amongst leading blockchains, enterprise-grade reliability, and a developer-friendly environment, Klaytn provides a seamless experience for users and developers that is second to none. Since its launch in June 2019, Klaytn has been accelerating blockchain mass adoption through a broad array of use cases from DeFi to real-world assets, entertainment and gaming, and even the Bank of Korea’s CBDC pilot project. Today, it is one of the only globally competitive Web 3.0 ecosystems developed in South Korea, generating more than 1 billion transactions from over 300 decentralized applications.

### What makes Klaytn unique?

#### An end-to-end metaverse developer package: 
To simplify building for the metaverse, Klaytn offers an end-to-end metaverse package that includes customized L2 solutions, SDKs and smart contract libraries, IPFS solutions, wallets, chain explorers, oracles and bridges, as well as an ecosystem of supporting services such as stablecoin integration, NFT marketplaces, tradfi interfaces, and more.

#### 1-second deterministic finality: 
Klaytn utilizes an optimized version of Istanbul BFT that enables transactions to achieve absolute finality within a second, allowing for responsive user experiences and enabling use cases where near-instant and irreversible finality is necessary—such as the real-time minting of in-game item drops.

#### Klaytn’s data guarantee: 
Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake blockchains exhibit probabilistic finality, which means there is a tiny chance that a transaction recorded on the chain can get reversed. This makes these blockchains unsuitable for mission-critical applications, especially if used at scale. Klaytn’s IBFT consensus algorithm guarantees that data recorded on the blockchain is correct and will never be reversed, in order to deliver the reliability and data consistency needed for large-scale applications.

#### Support for Ethereum equivalence: 
Klaytn supports EVM as one of the emerging standards for the metaverse and Web3, and will be adopting the EVM specification by:
* Making Klaytn’s technical stack equivalent to the Ethereum stack from an interfacing and execution perspective
* Building on top of existing Ethereum clients and interfacing libraries to inherit any improvements made to their open-source codebases
* Enabling Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and Klaytn Improvement Proposals (KIPs) to contribute to both ecosystems

#### A unique governance structure:
At the core of Klaytn’s unique take on decentralization is their Governance Council (GC). Comprising leading global enterprises and DAOs across geographies and industries, these GC members form a compact validator network that is able to deliver the benefits of a decentralized public blockchain while maintaining the performance of a permissioned blockchain. Moving forward, Klaytn aims to further increase decentralization by onboarding more DAOs to their GC to create a “DAO of DAOs”.

#### Built-in scalability via service chains:
Klaytn utilizes the hub-and-spoke model that is widely acknowledged as one of the leading scalability solutions. Klaytn’s spokes, or service chains, can be customized for specific DApp requirements such as high throughput, special node configurations, or custom security levels. In addition, support for nested service chains will provide the exponential scalability needed for metaverse-scale adoption.

#### The preferred enterprise-level blockchain:
Klaytn is the preferred blockchain for enterprises and enterprise-level use cases, counting industry titans such as Japan’s GMO Internet Group, Indonesia’s Salim Group, and mobile gaming giants Netmarble and WeMade amongst our partners. Klaytn is also the official blockchain partner for Bank of Korea’s CBDC project, which is running off a private, modified version of Klaytn.

### Who are the founders of Klaytn?
The Klaytn blockchain was developed and launched in June 2019 by GroundX, the blockchain subsidiary of Korea’s largest mobile platform, Kakao. After two years of success in Korea, the Klaytn Foundation—a non-profit entity devoted to the Klaytn network and its ecosystem—was established to begin Klaytn’s global expansion.

Klaytn Foundation is a non-profit organization that was established to accelerate global adoption and ecosystem maturity on Klaytn. The foundation manages the Klaytn Growth Fund and operates alongside Krust, a subsidiary of internet giant Kakao Corp that invests in projects built on Klaytn.

## What is KLAY?
KLAY is the native digital asset that fuels and secures the Klaytn protocol. Klaytn was launched with 10 billion KLAY issued at genesis, and there are currently 2.6 billion KLAY coins in circulation. With every new block, 9.6 KLAY will be minted and the newly issued KLAY and the sum of transaction fees used in the block (collectively called the “block reward”) will be aggregated and distributed to the following three destination accounts in accordance to the predetermined ratio:
* Klaytn Governance Council Reward: 34%
* Klaytn Growth Fund (KGF): 54%
* Klaytn Improvement Reserve (KIR): 12%

### Where can you buy KLAY?
KLAY is available for trading on a growing number of major exchanges, with [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/),
[Bithumb](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bithumb/), [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/), and many more offering cryptocurrency and stablecoin pairs.

Waves,WAVES,waves,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1274.png,coin,"## What Is Waves (WAVES)?

Waves is a multi-purpose [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) platform which supports various use cases including decentralized applications ([DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) and [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract).

Launched in June 2016 following one of the cryptocurrency industry’s earliest initial coin offerings ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)), Waves initially set out to improve on the first blockchain platforms by increasing speed, utility and user-friendliness. 

The platform has undergone various changes and added new spin-off features to build on its original design. 

Waves’ native token is WAVES, an uncapped supply token used for standard payments such as block rewards.  


### Who Are the Founders of Waves?

Waves is synonymous with its founder, Ukrainian-born scientist Alexander Ivanov (also known as Sasha Ivanov).

Prior to creating Waves, Ivanov was already active in the cryptocurrency space, having released the now-defunct instant exchange Coinomat and indexing site Cooleindex. He also created an early version of a [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin), CoinoUSD, tied to the U.S. dollar.

Ivanov is publicly active in his promotion of Waves, giving frequent interviews on the platform and trends in the wider blockchain industry.

According to Waves’ marketing literature, the company now employs over 180 people at locations including Moscow and Switzerland.  


### What Makes Waves Unique?

As one of the first offerings in its field, Waves set out to improve on the early blockchain platforms and products. 

From the outset, it aimed to appeal to prospective business clients looking to use blockchain to improve processes or create new services.

Waves supported smart contract and DApp development, ensuring that speeds and ease-of-use surpassed competition at the time. 

Since then, other products have appeared, including Gravity, a cross-chain and oracle network, and decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance)) focused platform Neutrino. Waves DEX is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange.

In 2020, Waves announced that its platform would be interoperable with the Ethereum network by releasing the WAVES token as an ERC-20 standard asset.

#### How Many Waves (WAVES) Coins Are There in Circulation?

WAVES began as a fixed-cap token for the Waves platform with 100 million tokens available. 

In its ICO — which raised 30,000 BTC — 85% of the supply went to sale participants, 4% to partners and supporters, 9% to the developers and 1% each to early supporters and bounty schemes which occurred after the ICO.

Its utility increased in time, and in 2019, it was decided to remove the supply cap, with decision-making transferred to network participants.

Currently, the block reward is 6 WAVES, and any changes come in the form of votes — users must choose whether or not to decrease the block reward by 0.5 WAVES every 110,000 blocks.


### How Is the Waves Network Secured?

Waves uses a modified [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) algorithm called WavesNG. The technology is based on Bitcoin-NG, a scaling proposal by well-known Bitcoin advocate, Cornell University developer Emin Gün Sirer.

Waves highlights that its code is open source, allowing for more trust and ease of maintenance than closed source enterprise blockchain solutions. 


### Where Can You Buy Waves (WAVES)?

WAVES, as a cryptocurrency on the market for over four years, is widely tradable on a large number of exchanges. 

Pairs operate between WAVES and other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies. 

Volumes are highly distributed, with [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) among the largest market venues.

The Graph,GRT,the-graph,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/6719.png,token,"To find out even more about this project, check out our deep dive of [The Graph](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/the-graph/).

## What Is The Graph (GRT)?

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol for querying data for networks like Ethereum and IPFS, powering many applications in both [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) and the broader [Web3 ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-the-graph). Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL to retrieve blockchain data. There is a hosted service in production that makes it easy for developers to get started building on The Graph and the decentralized network will be launching later this year. The Graph currently supports indexing data from Ethereum, IPFS and POA, with more networks coming soon. 

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [The Graph](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-the-graph).

To date, over[ 3,000 subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/explorer/) have been deployed by thousands of developers, for DApps like Uniswap, Synthetix, Aragon, AAVE, Gnosis, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Decentraland and many others. The Graph usage has been growing at over 50% MoM and hit over 7 billion queries during the month of September 2020. 

The Graph has a global community, including over 200 Indexer Nodes in the testnet and more than 2,000 Curators in the Curator Program as of October 2020. To fund network development, The Graph raised funds from community members, strategic VCs and influential individuals in the blockchain community including Coinbase Ventures, DCG, Framework, ParaFi Capital, CoinFund, DTC, Multicoin, Reciprocal Ventures, SPC, Tally Capital and others. The Graph Foundation also successfully completed a public GRT Sale with participation from 99 countries (not including the U.S.). To date as of November 2020, The Graph has raised ~$25M.  


### Who Are the Founders of The Graph?

The Graph team includes professionals from the Ethereum Foundation, OpenZeppelin, Decentraland, Orchid, MuleSoft leading up to the IPO and acquisition by Salesforce, Puppet, Redhat and Barclays.

The initial co-founding team includes Yaniv Tal (project lead), Brandon Ramirez (research lead) and Jannis Pohlmann (tech lead). 

The founders have engineering backgrounds and have worked together for 5-8 years. Tal and Ramirez studied electrical engineering at USC and worked together at MuleSoft, an API developer tools company that underwent an IPO and sold to SalesForce.  

They previously co-founded a developer tools startup together and have spent a significant portion of their careers working to optimize the API stack. At their last startup, the founders built a custom framework on an immutable database called Datomic. The Graph was born from this vision to create immutable APIs and data access, using the GraphQL query language.


#### What Makes The Graph Unique?

The Graph is working to bring reliable decentralized public infrastructure to the mainstream market. To ensure economic security of The Graph Network and the integrity of data being queried, participants use Graph Token (GRT). GRT is a work token that is locked-up by Indexers, Curators and Delegators in order to provide indexing and curating services to the network.

GRT will be an ERC-20 token on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), used to allocate resources in the network. Active Indexers, Curators and Delegators can earn income from the network proportional to the amount of work they perform and their GRT stake. Indexers earn indexing rewards (new issuance) and query fees, while Curators earn a portion of query fees for the subgraphs they signal on. Delegators earn a portion of income earned by the Indexer they delegate to.

#### How Many The Graph (GRT) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Total GRT supply at mainnet launch will be 10 billion tokens, with an initial circulating supply of ~1,245,666,867 GRT. New token issuance in the form of indexing rewards will begin at 3% annually and is subject to future technical governance by The Graph Council. You can read about GRT token economics [here](https://thegraph.com/blog/the-graph-grt-token-economics) and distribution information [here](https://thegraph.com/blog/announcing-the-graphs-grt-sale). 


### How Is The Graph Network Secured?

The Graph has built an open data layer on top of blockchains: Indexers can run their own Ethereum archive nodes to run Graph Node, or they can use node operators like Infura or Alchemy. 

Any analytics company can build an application to query subgraph data that’s indexed by The Graph. Subgraphs are open APIs to be able to pull data from the blockchain in the most seamless and efficient way.

BitTorrent(New),BTT,bittorrent-new,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/16086.png,token,"## What Is BitTorrent (BTT)?

BitTorrent is a popular peer-to-peer ([P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p)) file sharing and torrent platform which has become increasingly decentralized in recent years. 

Originally released in July 2001, BitTorrent was purchased by [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) platform [TRON](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/) in July 2018. 

Since its acquisition, BitTorrent has added various new tools, with a dedicated native cryptocurrency token, BTT, released in February 2019. BTT was launched on TRON’s own blockchain, using its TRC-10 standard.

According to its official literature, BitTorrent is currently the “largest decentralized P2P communications protocol” in the world.


### Who Are the Founders of BitTorrent?

The original BitTorrent is the brainchild of Bram Cohen, a developer and entrepreneur who himself has since become well known in the cryptocurrency arena.

Cohen has explained that he designed BitTorrent to usurp the dated entertainment industry, which made obtaining material slow and expensive. 

The platform has seen multiple legal battles, with Cohen maintaining that it does not break copyright laws in allowing users to share files such as music and movies among themselves.

In 2018, TRON completed its acquisition of BitTorrent, bringing BitTorrent under the control of Justin Sun. Sun is notorious for his plugging of both TRON as a cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology, bidding $4.5 million at a charity auction to have lunch with Warren Buffett (well-known anti-crypto figure) and discuss cryptocurrency with him.

TRON is also behind the addition of cryptocurrency to BitTorrent, as the BTT token was released on TRON’s blockchain. The move formed part of TRON’s efforts to add further decentralized features to the platform. 


#### What Makes BitTorrent Unique?

BitTorrent’s original goal was to disrupt the legacy entertainment industry and how consumers obtain content. 

Expensive and inefficient distribution networks were the main target, with original developer Bram Cohen seeing benefits in allowing internet users to distribute content among themselves directly.

In the early 2000s, BitTorrent became the go-to P2P file sharing platform, with TRON stepping in 2018. 

Under TRON, BitTorrent has expanded its user appeal to those interested in decentralized solutions and cryptocurrency, as well as to its own user base. 

Among the added features are BitTorrent Speed, which uses the BTT token as part of its operations.

BitTorrent has also branched out into paid services, offering several “premium” versions of its platform which include VPN capabilities and ad-free browsing.

#### How Many BitTorrent (BTT) Coins Are There in Circulation?

BTT is BitTorrent’s native cryptocurrency, issued on TRON’s blockchain as a TRC-10 standard token. 

The total supply, as stated in its whitepaper, is 990,000,000,000 BTT. 6% of that total was available in a public token sale, 2% in a private token sale and 9% in a seed sale.

Another 20.1% are reserved for airdrops, which are set to occur at various points until 2025. The BitTorrent team and umbrella organization, the BitTorrent Foundation, were awarded 19% of the supply. The TRON foundation holds 20%, with 19.9% going to the BitTorrent ecosystem itself.

A final 4% of tokens are reserved for partnership activities.

BTT plays various roles in BitTorrent’s products, including allowing users to pay others for faster downloads with BitTorrent Speed.


### How Is the BitTorrent Network Secured?

BitTorrent says that it employs “the highest level of security measures” in order to secure user funds, but advises that cryptocurrency involves inherent risk.

The company recommends that users protect themselves against theft, in the form of malware or similar programs, by using options such as biometric verification.

KuCoin Token,KCS,kucoin-token,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2087.png,token,"### What Is KuCoin Token (KCS)?

KCS is the native token of KuCoin, which was launched back in 2017 as a profit-sharing token that allows traders to draw value from the exchange. It was issued as an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum network and was supported by most Ethereum wallets. The total supply of KCS was set at 200 million, and there is a planned buyback and burn until just 100 million KCS remain. Sooner or later, as the KuCoin decentralized trading solution goes live, KCS will be the native asset of KuCoin's decentralized financial services as well as the governance token of the KuCoin community in the future.

KuCoin has also announced that “Empowering KCS'' will be a key priority of KuCoin and will build KCS as a killer product rather than a simple token, which is bound to further diversify the benefits that KCS holders can access. In the long run, KCS performs as the key to the entire KuCoin ecosystem. With the development of DEX and KuChain, KCS will also be the underlying fuel and general token for future KuCoin decentralized products. More details will likely be released in the near future.

### What Makes KuCoin Token Unique?

KCS Bonus is regarded as one of the best ways to get passive income. Users who hold more than 6 KCS can get a daily dividend, which comes from 50% of KuCoin's daily trading fee revenue. KCS Bonus is a unique incentive mechanism for KCS holders and KuCoin ecosystem builders. The amount of rewards that users can get depends on the number of KCS held and the trading volume of the KuCoin Exchange.

### What Is The KCS Used For?

Besides being paid out as a dividend, KCS, as a utility token, is also used to pay for trading fees on the KuCoin Exchange, allowing users to enjoy discounts of up to 80%. The use case of KCS also includes participation in the token sale on KuCoin Spotlight, as well as LockDrop/BurningDrop on the Pool-X platform. But this is not all, as KCS tokens also serve a series of other purposes on the platform. For instance, KCS holders can become KuCoin VIPs and users no longer need to have a huge BTC trading volume to unlock the reduced maker and taker fees. KCS can also be used as a payment method for shopping, making hotel reservations, buying gaming equipment, and more.

### What Is A KCS Burn?

The KCS initial supply was set at 200 million. KuCoin and the KCS team are buying back KCS from the market and burning them every quarter. The amount of KCS to be burned

depends on the quarterly trading volume of the KuCoin Exchange. So the circulating supply of KCS is decreasing and will eventually settle down at 100 million.

### How Is the KuCoin Token Network Secured?

KuCoin employs the standard encryption protocol that ensures that user data and data transfers within the system are hidden from other users.

It uses a multi-cluster and multi-layer architectural system that can accommodate more than one transaction at the same time, ensuring system stability throughout every transaction.



### Who Are the Founders of KuCoin Token? 

The KuCoin Exchange is a cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in Singapore. It launched on September 15, 2017. The company was originally co-founded in 2013 by the following people: COO Eric Don, marketing director Jack Zhu, president of business operations John Lee, operations and maintenance director Kent Li, chief legal consultant Linda Lin, CEO Michael Gan and CTO Top Lan.

Cosmos,ATOM,cosmos,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3794.png,coin,"## What Is Cosmos (ATOM)?

 In a nutshell, Cosmos bills itself as a project that solves some of the “hardest problems” facing the blockchain industry. It aims to offer an antidote to “slow, expensive, unscalable and environmentally harmful” [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) protocols, like those used by Bitcoin, by offering an ecosystem of connected blockchains.

The project’s other goals include making blockchain technology less complex and difficult for developers thanks to a modular framework that demystifies decentralized apps. Last but not least, an Interblockchain Communication protocol makes it easier for blockchain networks to communicate with each other — preventing fragmentation in the industry.

Cosmos’ origins can be dated back to 2014, when Tendermint, a core contributor to the network, was founded. In 2016, a white paper for Cosmos was published — and a token sale was held the following year. ATOM tokens are earned through a hybrid proof-of-stake algorithm, and they help to keep the Cosmos Hub, the project’s flagship blockchain, secure. This cryptocurrency also has a role in the network’s governance.

### Who Are the Founders of Cosmos?

The co-founders of Tendermint — the gateway to the Cosmos ecosystem — were Jae Kwon, Zarko Milosevic and Ethan Buchman. Although Kwon is still listed as principal architect, he stepped down as CEO in 2020. He maintains he is still a part of the project but is mainly focusing on other initiatives. He has now been replaced as Tendermint’s CEO by Peng Zhong, and the whole board of directors was given quite a substantial refresh. Their goals include enhancing the experience for developers, creating an enthusiastic community for Cosmos and building educational resources so greater numbers of people are aware of what this network is capable of.

## How Does Cosmos Work?

The Cosmos network consists of three layers: the [application layer](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/application-layer), the networking layer and the consensus layer.

The application layer processes transactions and updates the state of the network, while the networking layer allows communication between transactions and blockchains. The consensus layer helps nodes agree on the system's current state.

Cosmos uses a set of open-source tools to connect the various layers together and enable developers to build [dApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps).


### Tendermint

The most essential element of this layered design is the Tendermint BFT engine, the part of the network that allows developers to build blockchains without having to code them from scratch. With Tendermint, various processes that are essential to blockchains, such as the p2p network, consensus algorithm and transaction processing, are bundled into one package. This makes it much simpler to create a blockchain application, as it removes the need to start from scratch.


### Cosmos Hub and Zones

The Cosmos Hub was the first blockchain to be established on the Cosmos network. It's designed to function as a go-between for all the unique blockchains that have been formed within the Cosmos network, known as ""zones."" The Cosmos Hub validators are responsible for maintaining consensus across all zones, and they earn fees for doing so. The native token of the Cosmos Hub is ATOM, which is used to pay these fees.


### Tendermint Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

The heart of Tendermint is Tendermint Core, a [Proof-of-Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) [governance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance) mechanism that ensures the computers running Cosmos Hub are always in sync. It uses the Tendermint [Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft) consensus algorithm, a variant of PoS. Under this system, validators take turns committing new blocks of transactions to the chain.


### Cosmos SDK

The Cosmos team has also created the Cosmos software development kit (SDK), which allows them to use Tendermint's consensus algorithm to create blockchains. The SDK is based on the modular philosophy, meaning that developers can plug in various modules to build the kind of blockchain they need. It also allows for different programming languages to be used, making it accessible to a wider range of developers.

### What Makes Cosmos Unique?

A major concern for some in the crypto industry centers on the levels of fragmentation seen in blockchain networks. There are hundreds in existence, but very few of them can communicate with each other. Cosmos aims to turn this on its head by making this possible.

Cosmos is described as “Blockchain 3.0” — and as we mentioned earlier, a big goal is ensuring that its infrastructure is straightforward to use. To this end, the Cosmos software development kit focuses on modularity. This allows a network to be easily built using chunks of code that already exist. Long-term, it’s hoped that complex applications will be straightforward to construct as a result. 

Scalability is another priority, meaning substantially more transactions can be processed a second than more old-fashioned blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If blockchains are to ever achieve mainstream adoption, they’ll need to be able to cope with demand as well as existing payment processing companies or websites — or be even better.

### Cosmos Interchain Accounts Upgrade

The Interchain Foundation, a non-profit organization of the Cosmos ecosystem, announced the release of the Interchain Accounts upgrade on Feb. 17, 2022. Launched in April 2021, the Inter-Blockchain Communications (IBC) protocol is the Cosmos standard for blockchain [interoperability](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/interoperability). It allows an individual blockchain to control an account on a separate chain. There are 38 projects utilizing IBC currently, notably [Terra](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/), Crypto.org chain and Gravity bridge. The Interchain Accounts upgrade will be the largest to the ecosystem since [Stargate](https://stargate.cosmos.network/) — which enabled Cosmos blockchains to connect with each other using the standardized protocol for IBC for the first time ever. With Interchain Accounts, users can [stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking), vote, [swap tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-swap) and more on other blockchains. The upgrade serves the purpose of “enabling composability in IBC [which] allows innovation in distinct applications to be deployed without needing to upgrade the entire Interchain.”

### How Many Cosmos (ATOM) Coins Are There in Circulation?

ATOM has a very specific total supply — 260,906,513 to be exact. Of these, at the time of writing, about 203,121,910 were in circulation. It is worth noting that these cryptocurrencies aren’t mined — instead, they are earned through [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking).

Two private sales were held in January 2017, followed by a public sale in April of that year. This raised a total of $16 million, which is the equivalent of about $0.10 per ATOM.
 
Breaking down the token distribution, about 80% was allocated to investors, while the remaining 20% was split between two companies: All In Bits and the Interchain Foundation.

Cosmos has compared ATOM tokens to the ASICs that are used to mine Bitcoin. As a technical paper written by the Tendermint team explained: “It is a piece of virtualized hardware (economic capital) that you need to obtain in order to participate as a keeper in the network.”


### How Is the Cosmos Network Secured?

As we mentioned earlier, Cosmos uses a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Validator nodes that stake a higher quantity of ATOM tokens are more likely to be chosen to verify transactions and earn rewards. Nodes that are found to be acting dishonestly are penalized — and they can end up losing the tokens that they had at stake.

### Where Can You Buy Cosmos (ATOM)?

It is now available across a number of major exchanges — many people choose to [buy Cosmos](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Cosmos) on Binance, Coinbase and OKEx.

Description
In order to help those who suffered great losses from the recent NFT rekt like Azuki and many others, we have taken the initiative to distribute Relief Funds to thirty Blue Chip NFT holders. 
Relief payments are traditionally given to the needy, but now relief payments are given to blue-chip holders in turn. We understand the challenges they face and empathize with their plight. 

Relief Funds Airdrop Eligibility
To ensure a fair and transparent distribution of resources, we will provide a list-checking service. This service is designed to verify the eligibility of Blue Chip NFT holders, ensuring that the airdropped funds reach those who truly need assistance. Through this process, we aim to facilitate equitable distribution and enable the community to witness the transparent interaction between Nova and its members.

Lido DAO,LDO,lido-dao,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/8000.png,token,"## What Is Lido DAO (LDO)?

Lido DAO is a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) ([DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao)) which provides [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) infrastructure for multiple [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) networks.

Most notably, the platform provides a liquid staking solution for Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and receive [stETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steth/) (Lido staked ETH) tokens in exchange, which represent the user's staked ETH and staking rewards.

Lido DAO is secured by a mix of decentralized governance, audited code and smart contracts. The Lido protocol runs on Ethereum with help from smart contracts that process user deposits and distribute staking rewards, among other functions. Several third-party security firms have [audited](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits) Lido’s smart contracts in order to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

The platform’s native token is LDO - which also serves as the governance token for Lido DAO. Holders can participate in governance proposals and vote on key decisions such as board adjustments, new integrations and platform updates. LDO holders have the right to determine the development and operation of the platform.

LDO also has economic value: users can stake it on the Lido platform to receive ETH rewards, as well as used to pay transaction fees on the platform. 

At the time of writing, Lido supports liquid staking for coins of five blockchains: Ethereum, [Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-solana-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-solana-ecosystem), [Polygon,](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-polygon-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-polygon-ecosystem) [Polkadot](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-polkadot), and Kusama. 


## Who Are the Founders of Lido DAO?

Lido was established by Konstantin Lomashuk, Vasiliy Shapovalov and Jordan Fish in 2020. The organization was helped to launch by a collective of financial firms and angel investors.

The finance firms include Semantic VC, ParaFi Capital, Libertus Capital, Bitscale Capital, StakeFish, StakingFacilities, Chorus, P2P Capital and KR1. 

The handful of angel investors who also helped Lido get off the ground include Stani Kulechov of Aave, Banteg of Yearn, Will Harborne of Deversifi, Julien Bouteloup of Stake Capital and Kain Warwick of Synthetix.  


## What Makes Lido DAO Unique?

Lido aims to make staking more accessible to a wider range of users by [pooling](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking-pool) staked ETH from multiple users, which negates the need for any technical expertise on behalf of users. Users also don’t need to commit a minimum amount of 32 ETH to run their own validator, which lets more people stake their ETH. 

Lido Liquid Staking V2, or Lido V2, is the latest major release of the Lido DAO protocol. It was designed to provide a more efficient and versatile staking solution for Ethereum 2.0. 

One of Lido V2’s key features is its ""Liquid Staking"" model, which allows users to deposit ETH into the Lido pool and receive stETH (staked ETH) tokens in return. These tokens can be traded on secondary markets or used on “[LSDFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-lsdfi-overview-of-lsdfi-protocols)” protocols, providing users with a more liquid form of staked ETH that can be used for other purposes.

Overall, the Lido DAO network is a robust and secure system that enables users to participate in governance and earn rewards while helping the network to stay secure.

## How Many Lido DAO (LDO) Coins Are There in Circulation?

As of June 2023, the total circulating supply of Lido DAO tokens is 879,588,042 LDO, around 88% of the total supply. The max supply is 1,000,000,000 LDO. 

Looking at the tokenomics of LDO, the allocation of these tokens is as follows:

DAO treasury — 36.32%

Investors — 22.18%

Validators and signature holders — 6.5%

Initial Lido developers — 20%

Founders and future employees — 15%


## How Is the Lido DAO Network Secured?

Funds are secured within a smart contract, making them inaccessible to validators. Subsequently, LDO token holders vote in the Lido DAO to vet, select and onboard new node operators, and penalize existing ones slashed by chain rules.

Lido also has a $2,000,000 bug bounty program with the Immunefi platform, a leading DeFi bug bounty program. Lido Bug Bounty programs focus on avoiding user fund losses, denial of service, governance takeovers, data breaches and data leaks. Lido has already awarded $250,000 for 7 Bug Bounties.


## Where Can You Buy Lido DAO (LDO)?

Lido DAO (LDO) is available for purchase on major cryptocurrency exchanges including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/), [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/), [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/) and more.","{""website"":[""https://lido.fi/""],""technical_doc"":[""https://lido.fi/static/Lido:Ethereum-Liquid-Staking.pdf""],""explorer"":[""https://etherscan.io/token/0x5a98fcbea516cf06857215779fd812ca3bef1b32"",""https://www.oklink.com/eth/token/0x5A98FcBEA516Cf06857215779Fd812CA3beF1B32"",""https://explorer.solana.com/address/HZRCwxP2Vq9PCpPXooayhJ2bxTpo5xfpQrwB1svh332p"",""https://bscscan.com/token/0x986854779804799C1d68867F5E03e601E781e41b""],""source_code"":[""https://github.com/lidofinance""],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/LidoDAO"",""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/lido-dao"",""https://blog.lido.fi/""],""chat"":[""https://t.me/lidofinance"",""https://discord.gg/vgdPfhZ""],""announcement"":[],""reddit"":[""https://reddit.com/r/lidofinance""],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/lidofinance""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1027.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x5a98fcbea516cf06857215779fd812ca3bef1b32"",""ContractPlatform"":""Ethereum"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://etherscan.io/token/0x5a98fcbea516cf06857215779fd812ca3bef1b32""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1839.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x986854779804799C1d68867F5E03e601E781e41b"",""ContractPlatform"":""BNB Smart Chain (BEP20)"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://bscscan.com/token/0x986854779804799C1d68867F5E03e601E781e41b""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5426.png"",""ContractAddress"":""HZRCwxP2Vq9PCpPXooayhJ2bxTpo5xfpQrwB1svh332p"",""ContractPlatform"":""Solana"",""ContractPRCURL"":[],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://solana.fm/address/HZRCwxP2Vq9PCpPXooayhJ2bxTpo5xfpQrwB1svh332p""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/4172.png"",""ContractAddress"":""terra1jxypgnfa07j6w92wazzyskhreq2ey2a5crgt6z"",""ContractPlatform"":""Terra Classic"",""ContractPRCURL"":[],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://finder.terra.money/mainnet/address/terra1jxypgnfa07j6w92wazzyskhreq2ey2a5crgt6z""}]","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9022.png"",""Name"":""Trust Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.trustwallet.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9025.png"",""Name"":""MetaMask"",""URL"":""https://metamask.io/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9152.png"",""Name"":""Binance Chain Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/""}]",[]
Stellar,XLM,stellar,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/512.png,coin,"## What Is Stellar (XLM)?

Stellar (XLM) is a peer-to-peer ([P2P](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p)) decentralized network created in 2014 by The Stellar Development Foundation or Stellar.org. The network officially launched in 2015 with the purpose of connecting the world's financial systems and ensuring a protocol for payment providers and financial institutions. The platform is designed to move financial resources swiftly and reliably at minimal cost. Stellar links people, banks, payment processors and allows users to create, send and trade multiple types of crypto.

The basis of the network is its native digital currency - XLM or Lumens. XLM acts as an intermediate currency for operations and is also used to pay transaction fees. How it works: the protocol converts money in a few seconds, first into XLM, and then into the requested currency. 

The Stellar payment protocol is based on distributed ledger technology -- an open-source development, community-owned and distributed by community. The crypto asset of the Stellar platform helps with cross-border transactions, overcoming the problems of high fees and slow procedures. XLM is more focused on assisting individuals transfer money than they are with institutions. Thus, Stellar offers access to financial systems, and people can send money at low cost and promptly around the world.

Moreover, Stellar serves as a decentralized exchange and marketplace, with a built-in order book that tracks ownership of Stellar assets. Platform users can manage buy/sell orders, as well as select and set their preferred assets in settlements. XLM is a built-in coin that helps reduce transaction fees.

The network maintains a high level of security.  XLM holders must have at least one token in order to remain active on the network. This nuance performs a global goal - the execution of network transactions efficiently and with minimal time costs. Plus, Lumens offers protection against flood attacks by making microtransactions too expensive for hackers with no chance of profit, which keeps Stellar Network safe from serious threats.

The target audience of Stellar is the inhabitants of developing countries, ordinary users who are provided access to the global economy through fast, simple and inexpensive transactions. Stellar Network makes extensive use of Lumens to produce live convection as well as to send cash in multiple currencies; currency is sent from one peer, and the recipient can receive the amount in another currency. This feature is beneficial when a transaction is made between currencies without widely traded pairs. 

Support for multi-currency transactions is another competitive advantage of Stellar, and the ability for cross-currency transactions has only enhanced processes with foreign operations. Moreover, stable speed and low transaction costs are a privilege that users receive.

This functionality is powered by a development called Anchors (a bridge between different currencies and the network), which simplifies the exchange within the network and helps speed up the whole process.

In summary, the benefits of Stellar (XLM) include:

**Simplicity: **both in relation to the simplified currency exchange process and the ease of user access. Due to XLM, all transactions are seamlessly performed for both the sender and the recipient. And, in order to join Stellar Network, all retail users need is a stable internet connection and Lumen-enabled software;

**Decentralization:** The Stellar database is open-source. No one authority controls the movement of Lumens. Transactions are authorized by the community, the data is stored on the blockchain and anyone can check it;

**High speed of transfer and transaction confirmation** (facilitated by the Stellar [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) mechanism). The transaction time is about 3-5 seconds (confirmation is facilitated by the Stellar consensus mechanism), which is faster than bank transfers and cross-border payments. Stellar Blockchain is capable of supporting thousands of transactions per second that makes it possible to use [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) and multi-signatures;

**Low translation cost compared to alternative methods:** Stellar Blockchain has an annual inflation rate of 1%, which is a fixed amount.


Put simply, Stellar is an open network that allows money to be moved and stored. When it was released in July 2014, one of its goals was boosting financial inclusion by reaching the world’s unbanked — but soon afterwards, its priorities shifted to helping financial firms connect with one another through blockchain technology.

The network’s native token, lumens, serves as a bridge that makes it less expensive to trade assets across borders. All of this aims to challenge existing payment providers, who often charge high fees for a similar service.

If all of this sounds familiar, it is worth noting that Stellar was originally based on the Ripple Labs protocol. The blockchain was created as a result of hard fork, and the code was subsequently rewritten.

## Who Are the Founders of Stellar?

Jed McCaleb founded Stellar with the lawyer Joyce Kim after leaving Ripple in 2013 over disagreements about the company’s future direction.

In explaining the rationale behind Stellar in September 2020,[ McCaleb told CoinMarketCap](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/09/20/stellars-jed-mccaleb-crypto-doesnt-need-more-regulation-it-needs-clarity/): “The whole original design of Stellar is that you can have fiat currencies and other kinds of forms of value run in parallel with each other and with crypto assets. This is super important to drive this stuff mainstream.”

McCaleb’s goal is to ensure that Stellar can give people a way of moving their fiat into crypto — and eliminate the friction that people normally experience when they are sending money around the world.

He currently serves as the CTO of Stellar, as well as the co-founder of the Stellar Development Foundation. This not-for-profit organization aims to “unlock the world’s economic potential by making money more fluid, markets more open, and people more empowered.”

### What Makes Stellar Unique?

Fees are a sticking point for many. However, high costs when making cross-border payments aren’t just exclusive to fiat-based payments solutions such as PayPal — transaction fees have also been known to go through the roof on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains because of congestion.

Stellar is unique because every transaction costs just 0.00001 XLM. Given how one unit of this cryptocurrency only costs a few cents at the time of writing, this helps ensure that users keep more of their money.

Few blockchain projects have managed to secure partnerships with big-brand technology companies and fintech firms. A few years ago, Stellar and IBM teamed up to launch World Wire, a project that allowed large financial institutions to submit transactions to the Stellar network and transact using bridge assets such as stablecoins.

Although other blockchains have community funds, meaning that grants can be given to projects that help further the ecosystem, Stellar allows its users to vote on which ventures should be given this support.

## Stellar Lumens (XLM) Finding More Use Cases With SDF Partnerships

The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) has deepened its partnership with the traditional payment processor, MoneyGram, and confirmed new partnerships across the globe. In July, MoneyGram and SDF [announced](https://www.stellar.org/press-releases/moneygram-launches-pioneering-global-crypto-to-cash-service-on-the-stellar-network) the roll-out of a first-of-its-kind global on/off ramp ""crypto-to-cash"" service on the Stellar network. 

Powered by the Stellar blockchain and Stellar-enabled digital wallets, MoneyGram’s retail agent network and Circle’s [USD Coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) ([USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/)), the service provides FIAT users access to the world of cryptocurrency in several key remittance markets, including Canada, Kenya, the Philippines and the U.S., with more markets to follow. 

The service is a result of work that began in October 2021 when MoneyGram and SDF first reached a partnership. According to SDF, the service is a game changer in bridging the gap between physical and digital currencies on a global scale. 

""This service is a monumental step towards bridging the gap between physical and digital currencies in a way that has not been done before at scale. As it develops, this solution will pave the way for blockchain technology to further financial inclusion, creating fluidity between cash and crypto so more people can benefit from the digital economy,"" SDF said in its press release. 

SDF and MoneyGram are not ending their joint initiative with just the project. In March 2022, the two parties [announced](https://www.stellar.org/press-releases/stellar-development-foundation-and-moneygram-partner-with-techstars-to-spur-innovation-on-blockchain-based-cross-border-payments) a partnership with Techstars, a global investment business that provides access to capital, one-on-one mentorship and customized programming for entrepreneurs. Together, they intend to embark on an accelerator project that will mentor startups developing technologies that facilitate the movement of money to and from Latin America. 


## Stellar’s Focus Blockchain-Powered Payment Services

SDF also has a string of other partnerships it has reached recently including Flutterwave, Nium, WhiteBIT, Coinme, Mercado Bitcoin and OKCoin. It has also partnered with governments agencies, including the [central banks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/central-bank) of Brazil, Ukraine and Indonesia, as well as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). 

The partnerships have all been in line with Stellar's [roadmap for 2022](https://www.stellar.org/roadmap), which it carried over from 2021, to improve the global adoption of cryptocurrencies in traditional cross-border payment circles. The roadmap also sets that the network would test its readiness for future capabilities focused on trust-minimized innovation based on [interoperability](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/interoperability) and inclusion. 

Stellar is looking to brainstorm how to achieve the goals listed in the last phase of its 2022 roadmap and plan for 2023 during its annual conference named Meridian.

### How Many Stellar (XLM) Coins Are There in Circulation?

A total of 100 billion XLM were issued when the Stellar network launched in 2015 — but things have changed since the release date. At present, the total supply stands at 50 billion XLM, and the circulating supply is currently 20.7 billion.

In 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation announced that it was burning over half of the cryptocurrency’s supply. This means that it now controls approximately 30 billion XLM. While some of this capital is earmarked for marketing and helping the organization develop, about one third is reserved for making investments in other blockchain ventures.

Explaining why it took this drastic move — and promising not to burn any more XLM in the future — the foundation explained: “SDF can be leaner and do the work it was created to do using fewer lumens… Those 55.5 billion lumens weren’t going to increase the adoption of Stellar.”

### How Is the Stellar Network Secured?

This network is secured using the Stellar Consensus Protocol, which is described as having four main properties: “Decentralized control, low latency, flexible trust, and asymptotic security.”

Through SCP, anyone is able to join the process of achieving consensus, and no single entity can end up with the majority of decision-making power. Transactions are also confirmed cheaply and within a few seconds — and safeguards are in place if bad actors attempt to join the network.

### Where Can You Buy Stellar (XLM)?

It is possible to [buy Stellar](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Stellar-Lumens) from a wide range of top exchanges - including Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bittrex, Bitfinex, Upbit and Huobi.

Conflux,CFX,conflux-network,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/7334.png,coin,"## What Is Conflux (CFX)?

Conflux (CFX) is a public [layer-1](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) blockchain that was made to power decentralized applications ([dApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)), e-commerce, and [Web 3.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/web-3-0) infrastructure by being more scalable, decentralized, and secure than existing protocols. 

Conflux makes it easier to transfer valuable assets by making the process quick, effective, free of network congestion, and with low transaction costs. The platform is based on the Tree-Graph consensus mechanism, and it combines Proof-of-Work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) and Proof-of-Stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) algorithms to achieve consensus. The protocol uses Turing-complete [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) written in Solidity, just like those on  [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), and is compatible with the [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) (Ethereum Virtual Machine).

Conflux's growth is fueled by [CFX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/conflux-network/), the platform's native token, which gives users financial incentives to participate and engage more. The token is used to pay transaction fees, govern the network, and is given as compensation to miners who help secure the network via staking. 


## Who Are the Founders of Conflux?

Conflux was founded in 2018, but its fundamental technology has been in development since 2017. It aims to promote blockchain education and research through the Tree-Graph Research Institute, based in Shanghai. 

The company is led by its founder, Fan Long, a talented programmer who specializes in blockchain technology and cybersecurity. Long graduated from Tsinghua University, and he holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT, where he also received the university’s Best Dissertation Award. He is currently an assistant professor at Toronto University. 

Long’s two co-founders are YuanJie Zhang, Ming Wu (CTO), and the company's research director, Guang Yang. The core team is composed of scientists, business managers, researchers, and other professionals. 

The protocol's Tree-Graph consensus mechanism was created by Professor Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, a well-known figure in academic computer science, a Turing Award winner, a fellow of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the head scientist of the Conflux Foundation.


## What Makes Conflux (CFX) Unique?

The Conflux project has a distinctive technical architecture that is meant to solve a number of industry issues and make life easier for both [dApp](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) developers and common users. 

Conflux interoperates with other blockchains thanks to its cross-chain protocol, ShuttleFlow. This cross-chain bridge lets Conflux transfer assets to other networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Huobi Eco Chain, and OKEx Chain. 

The platform gives programmers access to a decentralized, secure, and scalable network, as well as a set of necessary tools and conditions that are compliant with the relevant regulations. As a result, developers can create multi-chain, scalable, secure, and censorship resistant dApps in line with the demands of investors and the crypto community. 

The Tree-Graph consensus algorithm used by Conflux ensures scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Due to the parallel processing of blocks and transactions, the network can process 300–6000 TPS of data per second.

Thanks to its scalability, Conflux provides lower fees compared to other networks like Ethereum. Additionally, because transaction fees are paid for by sponsors thanks to the Fee Sponsorship Mechanism, even users with negative balances can continue using the platform and engage with the blockchain.

Additionally, the platform has an integrated staking system that offers users who stake their coins passive rewards. Staking involves less risk than trading and offers more consistent rewards. Developers can choose to directly offer staking inside of dApps, and the system provides a financial framework for dApp development.

Zilliqa,ZIL,zilliqa,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2469.png,coin,"## What Is Zilliqa (ZIL)?

Zilliqa is a public, permissionless [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) that is designed to offer high throughput with the ability to complete thousands of transactions per second. It seeks to solve the issue of blockchain scalability and speed by employing sharding as a second-layer scaling solution. The platform is home to many [decentralized applications](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps), and as of October 2020, it also allows for [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) and [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming).

Development work officially started on Zilliqa in June 2017, and its testnet [went live](https://blog.zilliqa.com/zilliqa-testnet-v1-0-release-codename-red-prawn-27974ca46ecb) in March 2018. A little over a year later, in June 2019, the platform [launched](https://blog.zilliqa.com/zilliqa-mainnet-the-launch-and-beyond-4cd7e113369f) its mainnet.

The native utility token of Zilliqa, ZIL, is used to process transactions on the network and execute smart contracts.


### Who Are the Founders of Zilliqa?

Zilliqa was first conceived by Prateek Saxena, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore School of Computing. Saxena and several students in the School of Computing published a paper in 2016 that outlined how a sharding-focused blockchain could improve network efficiency and speed.

Around the same time, Saxena co-founded Anquan Capital alongside Max Kantelia, a lifelong finance and tech entrepreneur, and Juzar Motiwalla, former president of the Singapore Computer Society. The company incorporated Zilliqa Research in June 2017 to develop the Zilliqa network, bringing on Dong Xinshu as its CEO, Yaoqi Jia as its chief technology officer and Amrit Kumar as its chief scientific officer. All three previously worked as research fellows at the NUS School of Computing.


#### What Makes Zilliqa Unique?

Zilliqa [claims](https://www.zilliqa.com/platform) to be the world's first public blockchain to rely entirely on a sharded network. This allows it to achieve high throughput and a high rate of transactions per second, which it says solves the scalability issue. Because each shard processes transactions individually, as the network grows and the number of shards increases, the number of transactions that can be processed per second also increases. As well, records are immediately added to the Zilliqa blockchain after being processed, meaning that no additional time for confirmation is required.

Zilliqa seeks to become the blockchain of choice for large-scale enterprise use, including among the advertising, gaming, entertainment and financial services and payments industries. In its 2018 position paper, its team [states](https://docs.zilliqa.com/positionpaper.pdf) that the platform ""aims to rival traditional centralized payment methods such as VISA and MasterCard.""

Both Anquan Capital and Zilliqa Research, the company responsible for developing Zilliqa, hold significant reserves of ZIL.

As of 2021, the Zilliqa network is an active network that runs over [millions of transactions](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/stat/txCountHistory) each month. The blockchain has also been constantly scaling, going from averaging over 900 blocks produced a day when its main net launched to presently producing [over 2500 blocks](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/stat/blockCountHistory) a day.

#### How Many Zilliqa (ZIL) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Zilliqa has a fixed maximum supply of 21 billion tokens. ZIL was first [made available](https://blog.zilliqa.com/more-details-on-zilliqas-token-generation-event-4e1b78e0cf5a) for sale as an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token as a part of a token generation event that concluded in January 2018. The tokens were subsequently transferred to the Zilliqa mainnet in a token-swap event that [concluded](https://blog.zilliqa.com/zilliqa-successfully-wraps-up-token-swap-f8942e1ce743) in February 2020.

Before launching, Zilliqa generated 60% of all tokens (12.6 billion ZIL) to be distributed at the token generation event, and the remaining 40% (8.4 billion ZIL) will be created through the mining process. Ten percent of all tokens (2.1 billion ZIL) were reserved for Anquan Capital, 12% (2.52 billion ZIL) for Zilliqa Research, and 5% for contemporary and future Zilliqa team members — all of which were announced to be distributed quarterly over a three-year period.

Zilliqa is designed such that all tokens will be mined within 10 years, with the block mining reward slowly decreasing. According to its [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper), the project [aims](https://docs.zilliqa.com/whitepaper.pdf) to have 80% of the tokens (16.8 billion ZIL) mined within the first four years and 20% (4.2 billion ZIL) in the remaining six years.


### How Is the Zilliqa Network Secured?

The Zilliqa network is secured through a practical [Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft), or pBFT, [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) protocol, meaning that at least two-thirds of all nodes must agree that a record is accurate in order for it to be added to the blockchain. Each Zilliqa blockchain shard relies on a group of nodes to confirm a subsection of all the transactions, and once each shard has reached a consensus, a second group of nodes confirms the shards' collective results and adds a new block to the blockchain.

The network uses elliptic-curve cryptography to secure its consensus protocol and allows for multisignatures. In addition to the pBFT consensus protocol that secures its transaction records, Zilliqa also uses a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) algorithm to assign node identities and generate shards.

Zilliqa [developed](https://www.zilliqa.com/language) a new language, Scilla, for its [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). Short for Smart Contract Intermediate-Level Language, Scilla is a safety-focused language intended to automatically identify and eliminate security vulnerabilities at the language-level and make it easier to formally verify the safety of smart contracts through mathematical proofs.


### Where Can You Buy Zilliqa (ZIL)?

Zilliqa's native token, ZIL, is listed on several major [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) exchanges — including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [Bitfinex](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitfinex/) and Bithumb — where it is available to be traded against fiat currencies, [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) and other cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin SV,BSV,bitcoin-sv,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3602.png,coin,"## What Is Bitcoin SV (BSV)?

[Bitcoin SV (BSV)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-vs-bitcoin-cash-vs-bitcoin-sv) emerged following a hard fork of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain in 2018, which had in turn forked from the BTC blockchain a year earlier.

The goal of Bitcoin SV is to fulfill the original vision of the Bitcoin protocol and design as described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, early Bitcoin client software and known Satoshi writings. BSV aims to offer scalability and stability in line with the original description of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, as well as deliver a distributed data network that can support enterprise-level advanced blockchain applications.

To this end, it has removed artificial block size limits and re-enabled Script commands and other technical capabilities which had been historically disabled or restricted by the protocol developers of the BTC blockchain. This allows the network to process tens of thousands of transactions per second while maintaining extremely low transaction fees for micropayments, in addition to offering advanced capabilities such as tokens, smart contracts, computation and other data use cases.

The BSV network is unique in its capacity for unbounded on-chain scaling while also being more aligned with the original design of Bitcoin than any other blockchain.


## Who are the founders of Bitcoin SV (BSV)?

Blockchain technology company nChain developed the BSV node software and has regularly delivered protocol updates that restore the functionality of the original Bitcoin protocol.  nChain now provides the Bitcoin SV Infrastructure Team which continues to advance the node software and other infrastruture tools for the BSV network.

nChain Chief Scientist Craig Wright, who has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, has been a supporter of BSV since the split between BCH and BSV in 2018, following the proposal of controversial protocol changes by several BCH developers.

Entrepreneur Calvin Ayre is also a vocal advocate for BSV and regularly seeks investment opportunities in companies and projects building on the blockchain.

After BSV split from BCH, a Switzerland-based non-profit industry association known as Bitcoin Association was formed that now supports the global growth and adoption of the BSV blockchain and digital currency.  Work of the Bitcoin SV Infrastructure Team at nChain is performed at the request and direction of Bitcoin Association.

## What makes Bitcoin SV (BSV) unique?

BSV differs from other versions of Bitcoin in its adherence to the original Bitcoin protocol and focus on realising the vision for the Bitcoin network outlined in the Bitcoin white paper and other known Satoshi Nakamoto writings. Unlike BTC, which now primarily functions as an investment or store of value asset, BSV aims to offer a scalable and usable blockchain platform for efficient payments and distributed data applications for consumer, enterprise and government users.

Thanks to its unbounded block size, BSV can scale to meet market forces and accommodate the demands of any application and payment network without resorting to second-layer solutions.   In 2021, the BSV network mined the world’s first gigabyte (1000+ megabytes) level blocks – reaching up to 2 GBs in August 2021; for comparison, 2 GBs is 2000 times the 1MB block cap of the BTC network.  Block capacity of the BSV network is expected to continue growing further to support more transaction volume and data use caes.

With testing of the new node software, the BSV Infrastructure Team has already demonstrated the BSV network’s ability to handle up to 100,000 transactions per second and expects that capacity to be shown on the BSV mainnet and grow even higher in the future. With this capability, BSV rivals and aims to supersede the payment processing capabilities of platforms like VISA at a fraction of the cost to users.

BSV also offers a scalable and product-ready platform for blockchain application developers, many of whom have migrated from other networks such as Ethereum after encountering scaling issues as their adoption increased. BSV is capable of scaling along with user adoption, which means developers can be assured that transaction fees will remain low and interactions will be processed quickly.

The functionality of BSV is attractive to enterprise and government users, with the blockchain offering an efficient and stable platform for companies and agencies looking to experiment or build with blockchain technology. 


## How many Bitcoin SV (BSV) coins are there in circulation?

As defined by the original Bitcoin protocol, there will be a maximum of 21 million BSV coins in circulation. Fresh coins from this circulation are distributed to BSV miners via block rewards, which they earn in addition to transaction fees for validating blocks.

Block rewards for miners are cut by 50% at predefined periods to slowly shift the reliance of miners on these subsidies to transaction fees and to reduce the flow of new tokens as they approach their maximum quantity.


## How Is the Bitcoin SV network secured?

BSV is secured by the proof-of-work consensus mechanism as described in the Bitcoin white paper. This means that for a block containing new transactions to be added to the blockchain, miners must solve a complex mathematical problem using their computer’s processing power. The miner who solves this problem first earns the block reward and transaction fees, and their block is added to the chain.

As more blocks are built on top of their block, the validity of the transactions now stored on the chain are ratified by other nodes and become very difficult, if not virtually impossible, to alter.


## Where can you buy Bitcoin SV (BSV)?

DODO,DODO,dodo,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/7224.png,token,"## What Is DODO?

DODO is a DeFi protocol[decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) protocol and on-chain liquidity provider whose unique proactive market maker (PMM) algorithm aims to offer better liquidity and price stability than [automated market makers (AMM).](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm) 

The PMM pricing mechanism, which mimics human trading, utilizes [oracles](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/oracles-in-defi-101-a-deep-dive-by-tellor) to gather highly accurate market prices for assets. It then provides enough liquidity close to these prices in order to stabilize the portfolios of [liquidity providers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider) (LP), lower price slippage and negate [impermanent loss](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss) by allowing arbitrage trading as reward. 

DODO also caters for new crypto projects with a free [ICO listing](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) through its Initial DODO Offering (IDO) which requires issuers to only deposit their own tokens. 

DODO’s smart contract operates as an [ERC20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) network. 


## Who Are the Founders of DODO?

Dodo was officially [launched in August 2020](https://medium.com/dodoex/dodo-a-revolution-in-on-chain-liquidity-7bc339b9d391), founded by [Diane Dai](https://twitter.com/diane_0320?lang=en), [Radar Bear](https://twitter.com/bear_radar) and an anonymous development team. It initially attracted a $600,000 seed round led by Framework Ventures.

The team announced in September 2020 that it had successfully completed an additional $5 million private sale funding round, led by Pantera Capital, [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) Labs and Three Arrows Capital. 

The private sale round also attracted investment from several other prominent venture capital firms, cryptocurrency exchanges and trading firms that include Coinbase Ventures, Galaxy Digital, CMS Holdings and Alameda Research.


## What Makes DODO Unique?

DODO positions itself as one of the most competitive liquidity providers that offers very low transaction fees and price slippage through its PMM algorithm, first conceived in April 2020. 

The team claims their PMM algorithm provides superior pricing over that of AMM competitor [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/) due to a flatter price curve. 

The PMM collects funds near market prices to establish enough liquidity, which drops quickly the further the price moves from the market price. DODO automatically adjusts market prices in order to attract arbitrage that will help keep liquidity provider portfolios stable. 

This ensures more favorable pricing, higher fund utilization and decreased price slippage, single risk exposure and no impermanent loss [(explained here)](https://dodoex.github.io/docs/docs/advantages).

For traders, DODO offers sufficient liquidity comparable to that of centralized exchanges (CEX), which can be natively used by smart contracts for on-chain transactions such as liquidation and auctions. Arbitrageurs can also take advantage of price differences between DODO and other exchanges. 

Liquidity providers are not required to make a minimum deposit  and are not restricted on the type of asset they provide. LPs can create their own trading pairs, deposit their own tokens to negate price risk and also collect a portion of DODO transaction fees as rewards. 

DODO also attracts new crypto projects with a free listing as an Initial DODO Offering (IDO). Unlike AMM protocols, DODO does not require quote tokens, and IDO projects only need to deposit their own tokens to the liquidity pool, after which the PMM creates its own ask-side depth. To start an IDO, a project needs to only set the oracle price to a constant. Liquidity is improved by depositing more quote tokens.

## What Is DYDX (dYdX)?

[DYDX (dYdX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dydx/) is the governance token for the [layer 2](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2) protocol of the eponymous non-custodial decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. It serves to facilitate the operation of layer 2 and allows traders, liquidity providers and partners to contribute to the definition of the protocol's future as a community. 

Token holders are granted the right to propose changes on the dYdX’s layer 2, and are presented with an opportunity to profit through token staking and trading fee discounts.

Built on [Starkwire’s](https://starkware.co/) StarkEx scalability engine, layer 2 is used for trading of cross-margined perpetuals on the platform. The scaling solution allows dYdX to increase transaction speed, eliminate gas costs, reduce trading fees and lower​​ minimum trade sizes on the protocol.

An open-source platform with smart contract functionality, dYdX is designed for users to lend, borrow and trade crypto assets. Although dYdX supports spot trading, the main focus of the platform is on derivatives and margin trading.

The exchange was founded in 2017 with over $10 million in seed venture capitalist funding and went live in 2019. DXDY token [Initial coin offering (ICO)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico) was on September 9th 2021.


## Who Are the Founders of dYdX?

Antonio Juliano — an experienced programmer with a background in blockchain technology is the founder and CEO of DYDX. He first entered the crypto space in 2015 upon getting a job as a software engineer at [Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/ru/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/) — a cryptocurrency exchange platform. As a Princeton University graduate with a degree in computer science, Antonio Juliano embarked on his entrepreneurial journey and founded dYdX in early 2017 . 

Zhuoxun Yin is head of operations at dYdX. Не previously worked at _Nimble_ — a social sales and marketing CRM and _Bain & Company_ — a consulting service. Zhuoxun Yin studied at University of Queensland and has a bachelor's degree in commerce.


## What Makes dYdX Unique?

dYdX is a cryptocurrency exchange that combines advanced financial tools with decentralization. The platform supports [margin trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/margin-trading) — a financial product enabling investors to increase their exposure to digital assets through [leverage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/leverage). dYdX’s isolated margin allows users to assign particular funds in the account as part of a trade, while cross-margin utilizes all the assets a trader keeps on the platform. Perpetuals — a type of [futures](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/futures) contract that does not have a predetermined selling date, is also available for trading on dYdX. The exchange currently offers a maximum of 25x leverage on synthetic assets with no expiry date. 

Upon depositing funds into the account, dYdX users automatically begin to earn interest, as their assets are entered into the global lending pool specific to each cryptocurrency. The platform guarantees security for lenders by ensuring that borrowers have enough [collateral](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/collateral) in their account at all times. Borrowing on dYdX enables users to instantly acquire any asset available on the platform using funds in their possession as collateral for the loan. dYdX also features an order book architecture in contrast to automated market makers such as [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/). 

dYdX Layer 2 increases scalability of the network through use of a form of [zero-knowledge rollup](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zero-knowledge-rollup) — zkSTARKS. The technology receives proofs, while validating a batch of transactions off-chain. These proofs are then sent back to the blockchain, where they are verified by a smart contract. zkSTARKS makes it possible to remove expensive computations from the mainnet with no sacrifices in decentralization.

Together, with trading and liquidity provider rewards, dYdX introduces retroactive mining benefits, allowing the platform to show appreciation to historical users and incentivize them to trade on layer 2 protocol. The holders can stake their tokens in dYdX’s safety and liquidity pools. While the safety pool provides the platform with a safety net in case of a shortfall event, the liquidity pool serves to attract high quality market makers.

## How Is the dYdX Network Secured?

DYDX is an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token deployed on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) mainnet. dYdX’s layer 2 scaling solution is built on Starkwire’s ZK-STARKS technology and relies on Ethereum blockchain to verify transaction proofs.

When Will DYDX Trading Begin?

DYDX token first became available for purchase in September 2021.


## Can DYDX Hit $50?

During the two instances of notable [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) price drops over the month of September 2021, DYDX did not experience a considerable decrease in value. Furthermore, DYDX managed to double its value and went from $10.23 to $22.66 in a little over a month. Taking into account that dYdX is presently one of the leading decentralized exchanges that has already established itself in the crypto world, its newly released governance token has a good chance in maintaining the price growth and reaching $50.

Chainlink,LINK,chainlink,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1975.png,token,"## What Is Chainlink (LINK)?

Founded in 2017, Chainlink is a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) abstraction layer that enables universally connected [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract). Through a decentralized [oracle](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/oracles) network, Chainlink allows blockchains to securely interact with external data feeds, events and payment methods, providing the critical off-chain information needed by complex smart contracts to become the dominant form of digital agreement.

The Chainlink Network is driven by a large open-source community of data providers, [node](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/node) operators, smart contract developers, researchers, security auditors and more. The company focuses on ensuring that decentralized participation is guaranteed for all node operators and users looking to contribute to the network.

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Chainlink](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-chainlink).


### Who Are the Founders of Chainlink?

[Sergey Nazarov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeydnazarov/) is a co-founder and CEO at Chainlink Labs. He graduated with a degree in business administration from New York University, with a focus on philosophy and administration. His professional career began as a teaching fellow at NYU Stern School of Business. In 2009, Nazarov co-founded ExistLocal, a peer-to-peer marketplace for authentic local experiences.

In 2014, he also co-founded CryptaMail, a completely decentralized, blockchain-based email service. In 2014, Nazarov teamed up with [Steve Ellis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steveellis0606/) and launched SmartContract, a platform that brings smart contracts to life by connecting them to external data and widely accepted bank payments. SmartContract was one of the entrepreneurial ventures that led Sergey Nazarov to the founding of Chainlink.

Steve Ellis graduated with a degree in computer science from New York University in 2010. Right after graduating, he became a software engineer at Pivotal Labs. In 2014, he co-founded the Secure Asset Exchange, a company facilitating easy web access to a decentralized asset exchange.


### What Makes Chainlink Unique?

Chainlink is one of the first networks to allow the integration of off-chain data into smart contracts. With many trusted partners, Chainlink is one of the major players in the data processing field. Due to the integration of off-chain data, Chainlink has attracted the attention of numerous trusted data providers, including Brave New Coin, Alpha Vantage and Huobi. Data providers can sell access to data directly to Chainlink, thus monetizing the information they have.

As a decentralized network, Chainlink allows users to become node operators and earn revenue by running critical data infrastructure required for blockchains’ success. Chainlink uses a large collection of node operators to collectively power a wide range of decentralized Price Feed oracle networks live in-production, which currently secure billions in value for leading DeFi applications like [Synthetix](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/synthetix-network-token/), [Aave](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/), [Compound](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/) and more.

### Chainlink and Google, Introduction of Staking in 2022

Chainlink has grown from aggregating and providing cryptocurrency price data to [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) protocols like Aave, to a lot more. The ecosystem currently access over 1B data points, securing over $75B in value through 1,000 project integrations with 700 [oracle](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/oracles) networks. Mainstream organizations like AccuWeather, FedEx, FlightStats and the Associated Press have partnered with Chainlink for data verification. However, one of the biggest wins Chainlink have secured is onboarding Eric Schmidt, ex-Google chairman and CEO, as a technical advisor to the oracle network protocol. According to Schmidt, ""Chainlink is a secret ingredient to unlocking the potential of smart contract platforms and revolutionizing business and society,"" and he is interested in helping Chainlink build a world powered by truth. Schmidt joins other notable Chainlink advisors including former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner and DocuSign co-founder Tom Gonser. 

On the roadmap for 2022, Chainlink will finally rollout staking for LINK holders to secure the network and earn rewards. Chainlink has been working on a [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) solution for years, however oracle networks are not a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) but a form of decentralized computing.  Co-founder Nazarov explained that Chainlink does not produce blocks but “make consensus on hundreds of oracle networks about price data.” He says the team is finally satisfied with the security and scalability of the [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism) and ready to launch staking this year.

## Securing the Chainlink Oracle Network With Staking 

In December 2021, the Chainlink oracle network introduced the staking of the LINK token to promote ""sustainable growth and security."" 

With LINK staking, Chainlink intends to bring a new layer of ""crypto economic"" security to the oracle network. It will do this by giving ecosystem participants, including [node](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/node) operators and community members, the ability to increase the security of Chainlink's oracle services by backing them with staked LINK tokens. 

This functions just like other [crypto-staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/crypto-staking-guide-2021) platforms where participants in a [Proof-of-Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) network have to lock up a specific amount of tokens to contribute to the security of the network. 


## How Will LINK Staking Work?

At present, Chainlink has been criticized for its dependence on a limited number of trusted nodes despite its efforts to be as decentralized as possible. However, LINK staking intends to remove this concern. 

LINK staking will introduce rewards and penalties to incentivize the proper operation of the Chainlink oracle network. It will also enhance the ability of node operators to receive tasks and earn fees within the Chainlink network. 

In this system, participants will lock up their LINK tokens as collateral. This [collateral](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/collateral) can be taxed or “slashed” if a node misreports data. The LINK tokens taxed from dishonest validators will be redistributed as earnings to honest validators. 

The developers of Chainlink hope that the introduction of this crypto-economic security should make the cost of attacking the network's price oracle greater than the potential profits an attack would generate. This is a similar gamification strategy that blockchain networks, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, depend on. 

Similarly, LINK holders that do not run their own node can participate in staking by delegating their tokens to a trusted node operator. Chainlink developers estimate that the staking program will offer a 5% return initially from a combination of emissions from the Treasury and fees paid by users of Chainlink's data feeds, and it will ultimately rely on only fees earned by the network. 

The participation of community members in staking will further incentivize node operators to remain honest. Participants will be able to choose where to delegate their stake through reputation scores given to node operators that consistently provide valid data feeds. 


## Chainlink Economics 2.0

The first iteration of LINK staking, named version 0.1, is expected to be launched by the end of 2022. Its success will determine the launch time for version 1.0 and then a full version with all functionalities, named 2.0. 

The launch of LINK staking will officially kick off the Chainlink Economics 2.0 era. Chainlink's co-founder, Sergey Nazarov, believes that this era will usher in society's inevitable shift to cryptographically guaranteed systems. 

“A society powered by cryptographic guarantees needs a system of cryptographic truth to prove what happened, whether that’s about random numbers, market data, weather events, or even just computations that the trust-minimized application needs. This is the world that we’re moving towards,"" Nazarov said in an [interview](https://chainlinktoday.com/chainlink-economics-2-0-to-accelerate-global-shift-toward-cryptographically-guaranteed-systems/). 

#### How Many Chainlink (LINK) Coins Are There in Circulation?

During the initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) for LINK in September 2017, Chainlink announced a total and maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 LINK tokens. The current supply is about 453,509,553 LINK tokens, or about 45% of the total supply, as of end-September 2021. The Chainlink price at ICO was $0.11 and a total of 350 million LINK tokens were sold. This represents an over 200X from the ICO price to Chainlink price today.

Chainlink price experienced a massive bull run in the period around mid-2019 to mid-2020. Chainlink bulls were colloquially referred to as “LINK Marines,'' becoming a well-known meme in the crypto community. Chainlink price reached an all-time high of $52.88 on May 9, 2021, on the back of an overall crypto market rally, as well as ongoing developments in the Chainlink ecosystem.

According to the [ICO documentation](https://link.smartcontract.com/whitepaper), 35% of the total token supply will go towards node operators and the incentivization of the ecosystem. Another 35% of LINK tokens were distributed during public sale events. Lastly, the remaining 30% of the total token supply was directed towards the company for the continued development of the Chainlink ecosystem and network.


### How Is the Chainlink Network Secured?

As an [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)-based [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, Chainlink is secured by the proof-of-stake ([PoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)) consensus mechanism. Unlike the proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) consensus utilized by Bitocin, PoS relies on the amount of staked tokens for selecting node validators.

PoS protocols were created with the idea to battle the vast power consumption required by PoW systems. PoS models are becoming increasingly popular as they need less electrical power and are easily scalable. While PoW has proven itself a reliable consensus mechanism, Ethereum and all other ERC-20 tokens have been growing rapidly and setting the trend in the space.


### Where Can You Buy Chainlink (LINK)?

Chainlink and the LINK token are among the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market. Considering this, a lot of exchanges have pushed to start offering trades in LINK. One top exchange to [buy Chainlink](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-ChainLink) is Binance.

Compound,COMP,compound,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5692.png,token,"## What Is Compound (COMP)?

Compound is a [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance) lending protocol that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrencies by depositing them into one of several pools supported by the platform. 

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Compound](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-compound).

When a user deposits tokens to a Compound pool, they receive cTokens in return. These cTokens represent the individual’s stake in the pool and can be used to redeem the underlying cryptocurrency initially deposited into the pool at any time. For example, by depositing ETH into a pool, you will receive cETH in return. Over time, the exchange rate of these cTokens to the underlying asset increases, which means you can redeem them for more of the underlying asset than you initially put in — this is how the interest is distributed. 

On the flip side, borrowers can take a secured loan from any Compound pool by depositing collateral. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio varies based on the collateral asset, but currently ranges from 50 to 75%. The interest rate paid varies by borrowed asset and borrowers can face automatic liquidation if their collateral falls below a specific maintenance threshold.

Since the launch of the Compound mainnet in September 2018, the platform has skyrocketed in popularity, and recently passed more than $800 million in total locked value. 


### Who Are the Founders of Compound?

Compound was founded in 2017 by Robert Leshner and Geoffrey Hayes, both of whom previously worked in high-profile roles at Postmates — an online food delivery service. The two continue to hold executive positions at Compound Labs, Inc — the software development firm behind the Compound protocol, with Leshner currently serving as CEO, while Hayes is the CTO.

Though both founders have experience founding successful companies, Robert Leshner, in particular, has been particularly active in helping to grow the [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) space, and has publicly invested in popular crypto platforms including Argent Wallet, Opyn, and Blockfolio. 

The Compound team now comprises over a dozen individuals — almost half of which work as engineers.


### What Makes Compound Unique?

According to Compound, the majority of cryptocurrencies sit idle on exchange platforms, doing nothing for their holders. Compound looks to change this with its open lending platform, which allows anybody who deposits supported Ethereum tokens to easily earn interest on their balance or take out a secured loan — all in a completely trustless way. 

Compound’s community governance sets it apart from other similar protocols. Holders of the platform’s native governance token — COMP — can propose changes to the protocol, debate and vote whether to implement changes suggested by others — without any involvement from the Compound team. This can include choosing which cryptocurrencies to add support for, adjusting collateralization factors, and making changes to how COMP tokens are distributed.

These COMP tokens can be bought from third-party exchanges or can be earned by interacting with the Compound protocol, such as by depositing assets or taking out a loan.

#### How Many Compound (COMP) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Like many digital assets, only a fixed number of COMP tokens will ever come into existence. The total supply is capped at 10 million COMP and as of writing, less than a third are in circulation (~3.3 million). 

Out of these 10 million tokens, just over 4.2 million tokens will be distributed to Compound users over a 4-year period. The second biggest allotment (almost 2.4 million COMP) goes to the Compound Labs, Inc shareholders, whereas 2.2 million tokens will be distributed to the Compound founders and current team with a 4 year vesting schedule. 

Finally, 775,000 COMP are reserved for community governance incentives and the remaining 332,000 tokens will be allocated to future team members. 

The exact rate of COMP emission is subject to change over time, as voters are able to increase or reduce the emission rate by passing a proposal through [community governance](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-governance-decentralized-b18659f811e0). 


### How Is the Compound Network Secured?

Everything on Compound is handled automatically by [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), which act to mint cTokens after [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) and [ERC20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) assets are deposited, and allow Compound users to redeem their stake using their cTokens. 

The protocol enforces a collateralization factor for all assets supported by the platform, ensuring each pool is overcollateralized at all times. If the collateral falls below the minimum maintenance level, it will be sold to liquidators at a 5% discount, paying down some of the loan and returning the remainder to an acceptable collateralization factor. 

This arrangement helps to ensure borrowers maintain their collateral levels, provides a safety net for lenders, and creates an earning opportunity for liquidators. 


### Where Can You Buy Compound (COMP)?

COMP is currently available to trade on hundreds of cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/), [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/) and [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/).

Moonbeam,GLMR,moonbeam,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/6836.png,coin,"To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Moonbeam](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-moonbeam-glmr).

## What Is Moonbeam (GLMR)?

[Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/) is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot. Moonbeam makes it easy to use popular Ethereum developer tools to build or redeploy Solidity projects in a Substrate-based environment. 

Moonbeam is much more than just an EVM implementation: it’s a highly specialized parachain that mirrors Ethereum’s Web3 RPC, accounts, keys, subscriptions, logs, and more. The Moonbeam platform extends the base Ethereum feature set with additional features such as on-chain governance, staking, and cross-chain integrations. 

Moonbeam’s Ethereum compatibility is unmatched:

* **Minimal Changes:** developers can use existing Solidity smart contracts right away, with no need to rewrite or reconfigure

* **Use Existing Developer Tools:** connect popular tools like MetaMask, Hardhat, Waffle, Remix, and Truffle via a complete set of Web3 RPC endpoints. Use well-known Javascript libraries such as Web3.Js or Ethers.Js.

* **Unified Accounts, Addresses, and Signatures:** use your existing Ethereum H160 accounts & ECDSA signatures to interact with Moonbeam

* **Tap into the Most Integrations on Polkadot:** use existing oracles, bridges, wallets, and other tools that are already building on Moonbeam

Moonbeam provides integration and connectivity between Polkadot [Parachains](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-parachains-2) as well as with other chains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin via bridges. Moonbeam was started in 2019 by Derek Yoo of [Pure Stake](https://www.purestake.com).


## Who Are the Founders of Moonbeam?

The Moonbeam Network was founded by Derek Yoo, the CEO of [PureStake](https://www.purestake.com) – a platform that provides secure and reliable public blockchain infrastructure to blockchain app developers, projects and enterprises.

Stefan Mehlhorn, a specialist in early-stage company management and operation, serves as the chief operations officer of both Moonbeam and PureStake. Stefan previously worked with Samsung Pay, Candibell Inc., LoopPay, Permessa, Thinking Phone Network among others.

Katie Butler and Nate Hamilton from [PureStake](https://www.purestake.com) head the marketing and business development teams of the Moonbeam Network respectively.

You can find more info about the team here: https://www.purestake.com/about/


## What Makes Moonbeam Unique?

Moonbeam offers an Ethereum-like environment on top of Substrate (rather than a Geth-based solution). This lets developers redeploy their existing smart contracts easily, using the same tools and integrations they already use, but also take advantage of the modern Substrate framework on which all Polkadot parachains are built.

The Moonbeam network makes it possible for developers with Solidity or Vyper-based smart contracts to ""go multi-chain"" and extend their influence into the Polkadot ecosystem. Polkadot’s blockchain ensures seamless sharing of workloads on a new layer.

Through Moonbeam, developers can port their existing Ethereum DApps to Polkadot or easily create new [permissionless](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/permissionless) [decentralized applications](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) (dApps) using familiar Ethereum development tools. The tools on Moonbeam ensure that there is minimal change when front-end dApps are moved between chains.

By using Moonbeam, Ethereum developers (which is the largest market of existing blockchain developers) will be able to bypass the scalability challenges due to the expense and constraints of the Ethereum network.

## How Many Moonbeam (GLMR) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The native token of Moonbeam known as Glimmer (GLMR) was issued via a private Community Event called Take Flight. During the community event of Moonbeam, 100,000,000 GLMR (10% of the total supply) was issued. 

There will be a total of 1,000,000,000 GLMR tokens, with an annual inflation rate of 5%, as such, there will be an uncapped token supply. The distribution of the token is as [follows](https://moonbeam.foundation/glimmer-token/).


## How Is the Moonbeam Network Secured?

The Moonbeam project is going down the path of decentralized governance. The utility token, Glimmer (GLMR), will serve as the gateway for network participants to access the vital functions of the network.

Holders of GLMR will have the right to propose referenda, vote, and elect council members. A reflection of Polkadot’s nominated [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism). Moonbeam benefits from the extra scalability and security of using a Polkadot sharded design and shared security umbrella.


## Where Can You Buy Moonbeam (GLMR)?

Depending on where you currently live, users can purchase GLMR using the centralized exchanges displayed by CoinmarketCap.

It's also possible to use certain DeFi protocols that are building on Moonbeam which users can find either on DappRadar, on Moonbeam's site, or DefiLlama. Please do your own research and due diligence when it comes to using DeFi protocols on Moonbeam.

Monero,XMR,monero,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/328.png,coin,"## What Is Monero (XMR)?

Monero was launched in 2014, and its goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography.

The team behind Monero say [privacy](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-privacy-coins) and security are their biggest priorities, with ease of use and efficiency coming second. It aims to provide protection to all users — irrespective of how technologically competent they are.

Overall, XMR aims to allow payments to be made quickly and inexpensively without fear of censorship.

## Who Are the Founders of Monero?

Seven developers were initially involved in creating Monero — five of whom decided to remain anonymous. There have been rumors that XMR was also invented by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto), the inventor of Bitcoin.

XMR’s origins can be traced back to Bytecoin, a privacy-focused and decentralized cryptocurrency that was launched in 2012. Two years later, a member of the Bitcointalk forum — only known as thankful_for_today — forked BCN’s codebase, and Monero was born. They had suggested “controversial changes” to Bytecoin that others in the community disagreed with and decided to take matters into their own hands.

It’s believed that hundreds of developers have contributed to XMR over the years.

## What Makes Monero Private?

Users shouldn't view all privacy cryptocurrencies as interchangeable or equivalent services because they don't all achieve privacy in the same way. For instance, XMR should be considered a technology that, when used properly, obscures user data on the blockchain, making it harder to identify its users.


## What Gives Monero Value?

The secrecy and anonymity offered by Monero are what most users find valuable. It gives people the freedom to conduct cryptocurrency transactions anytime they want for any purpose without being concerned about being watched by the government, hackers or other outside parties. XMR coins cannot be traced, thus they cannot be blacklisted by businesses for alleged illicit connections.

Investors who think that demand for privacy will rise in the future, raising the price and total [market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/market-capitalization-market-cap-mcap) of XMR, may find value in Monero in addition to its use as a medium of exchange.

## Mining on Monero

Monero uses a [Proof-of-Work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow) algorithm, RandomX, to validate transactions. The method was introduced in November 2019 to replace the former algorithm CryptoNightR. Both were designed to be [ASIC-resistant](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/asic-resistant). 

[Monero can be mined](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mine-monero) somewhat efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, such as x86, x86-64, ARM and GPUs, a design decision that was based on Monero's opposition to mining centralization that [ASIC](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/asic) mining creates. However, it has also resulted in Monero's popularity among malware-based non-consensual miners.<sup> </sup>

In October of 2021, the Monero project introduced P2Pool, a mining pool running on a [sidechain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/side-chain) that gives participants full control of their node as with solo mining configurations.

### What Makes Monero Unique?

There are several things that make Monero unique. One of the project’s biggest aims is achieving the greatest level of decentralization possible, meaning that a user doesn’t need to trust anyone else on the network.

Privacy is achieved through a few distinctive features. Whereas each Bitcoin in circulation has its own serial number, meaning that cryptocurrency usage can be monitored, XMR is completely fungible. By default, details about senders, recipients and the amount of crypto being transferred are obscured — and Monero advocates says this offers an upper hand over rival privacy coins such as Zcash, which are “selectively transparent.”

Obfuscation is achieved through the use of ring signatures. Here, past transaction outputs are picked from the blockchain and act as decoys, meaning that outside observers can’t tell who signed it. If Ian was sending 200 XMR to Susan, this amount could also be split into random chunks to add a further level of difficulty.

To ensure that transactions cannot be linked to one another, stealth addresses are created for every single transaction that are only used once.

All of these distinctive features have led to XMR being increasingly used for illicit transactions instead of Bitcoin — especially on darknet markets. Governments around the world, especially the U.S., have also offered hundreds of thousands of dollars to anyone who can crack Monero’s code.

### How Many Monero (XMR) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Monero is slightly unusual as a token sale wasn’t held for XMR — and no tokens were premined either. At the time of writing, the circulating supply of XMR stands at 18,188,773.23.

This cryptocurrency is designed to be resistant to application-specific integrated circuits, which are commonly used for mining new Bitcoin. In theory, this means that it can be possible to mine XMR using everyday computing equipment.

Overall, there will eventually be a total of 18.4 million XMR in circulation — and this cap is expected to be reached on May 31, 2022. After this, miners will be incentivized using “tail emissions,” with a small amount of XMR being fed into the system every 60 seconds as a reward. It is believed this approach is more effective than relying on transaction fees.

### How Is the Monero Network Secured?

One of Monero’s main goals has to prevent centralization — and this network uses a consensus mechanism called CryptoNight, which is [based on](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mine-monero) proof-of-work. This prevents large mining farms from becoming a dominant force. 

### Where Can You Buy Monero (XMR)?

Because of its nature as a privacy coin, XMR isn’t listed on some major exchanges. For example, although you can [buy XMR on Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Monero), it isn’t supported by Coinbase. As a result, you may need to convert your fiat into Bitcoin and go through a smaller trading platform. This guide[ helps explain](https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) how you can convert fiat currencies into crypto with ease. As it’s use grows there has been increased interest in the [XMR to AUD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/xmr/aud/) and [XMR to EUR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/xmr/eur/) price pairs.","{""website"":[""https://www.getmonero.org/""],""technical_doc"":[""https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/blob/master/whitepaper/whitepaper.pdf""],""explorer"":[""http://moneroblocks.info/"",""http://chainradar.com/xmr/blocks"",""https://blockchair.com/monero""],""source_code"":[""https://github.com/monero-project/monero""],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/Monero"",""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/monero"",""https://forum.getmonero.org/"",""https://forum.monero.space/""],""chat"":[""https://telegram.me/monero""],""announcement"":[""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583449.0""],""reddit"":[""https://reddit.com/r/monero""],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/monero""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5604.png"",""ContractAddress"":""secret19ungtd2c7srftqdwgq0dspwvrw63dhu79qxv88"",""ContractPlatform"":""Secret"",""ContractPRCURL"":[],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://secretnodes.com/secret/chains/secret-4/contracts/secret19ungtd2c7srftqdwgq0dspwvrw63dhu79qxv88""}]","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9017.png"",""Name"":""Ledger"",""URL"":""https://www.ledger.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9020.png"",""Name"":""Trezor"",""URL"":""https://www.trezor.io/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9058.png"",""Name"":""Math Wallet"",""URL"":""http://www.mathwallet.org/cn/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9022.png"",""Name"":""Trust Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.trustwallet.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9138.png"",""Name"":""Safepal"",""URL"":""https://www.safepal.io/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9147.png"",""Name"":""GUI Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9188.png"",""Name"":""Atomic wallet"",""URL"":""https://atomicwallet.io/""}]",[]
Litecoin,LTC,litecoin,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/2.png,coin,"## What Is Litecoin (LTC)?

Litecoin (LTC) is a cryptocurrency that was designed to provide fast, secure and low-cost payments by leveraging the unique properties of [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) technology.

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Litecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/litecoin).

The cryptocurrency was created based on the [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (BTC) protocol, but it differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used, hard cap, block transaction times and a few other factors. Litecoin has a block time of just 2.5 minutes and extremely low transaction fees, making it suitable for micro-transactions and point-of-sale payments.

Litecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub on Oct. 7, 2011, and the Litecoin Network went live five days later on Oct. 13, 2011. Since then, it has exploded in both usage and acceptance among merchants and has counted among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for most of its existence.

The cryptocurrency was created by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee, who intended Litecoin to be a ""lite version of Bitcoin,"" in that it features many of the same properties as Bitcoin—albeit lighter in weight.


### Who Are the Founders of Litecoin?

As we previously touched on, Litecoin was founded by Charlie Lee, an early cryptocurrency adopter and a name held in high regard in the cryptocurrency industry.

Charlie Lee, also known as “Chocobo,” is an early Bitcoin miner and computer scientist, who was a former software engineer for Google. In addition, Charlie Lee held the role of director of engineering at Coinbase between 2015 and 2017 before moving on to other ventures.

Today, Charlie Lee is an outspoken advocate of cryptocurrencies and is the managing director of the Litecoin Foundation—a non-profit organization that works alongside the Litecoin Core Development team to help advance Litecoin.

Besides Lee, the Litecoin Foundation also includes three other individuals on the board of directors: Xinxi Wang, Alan Austin and Zing Yang — all of which are accomplished in their own right.


#### What Makes Litecoin Unique?

Behind Bitcoin, Litecoin is the second most popular pure cryptocurrency. This success can be largely attributed to its simplicity and clear utility benefits.

As of January 2021, Litecoin is one of the most widely accepted cryptocurrencies, and more than 2,000 merchants and stores now accept LTC across the globe.

Its main benefit comes from its speed and cost-effectiveness. Litecoin transactions are typically confirmed in just minutes, and transaction fees are nearly negligible. This makes it an attractive alternative to Bitcoin in developing countries, where transaction fees may be the deciding factor on which cryptocurrency to support.

In late 2020, Litecoin also saw the release of the [MimbleWimble](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-mimblewimble) (MW) testnet, which is used to test Mimblewimble-based confidential transactions on Litecoin. Once this feature is available on the mainnet, Litecoin users will also benefit from greatly enhanced privacy and fungibility.

### Litecoin Mimblewimble Upgrade

Litecoin Foundation announced the long-awaited Mimblewimble Extension Block (MWEB) upgrade as part of the Litecoin Core 0.21.2 release candidate on Jan. 31, 2022. MWEB is “set to be the largest upgrade to the Litecoin network ever, promising to provide fungibility for all, while improving Litecoin's scalability.” MWEB will be an opt-in feature, allowing Litecoin to be the “most fungible, cash-like, cryptocurrency in the space.” The security and privacy enhancing Taproot upgrade will also be part of the core release.

# Some Exchanges Delist LTC After MimbleWimble Upgrade

[MimbleWimble](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-mimblewimble) is an upgrade enabling users to achieve much-needed privacy while transacting on the network. The MimbleWimble upgrade was first proposed in November 2019 through a Litecoin Improvement Proposal. At the time, the Litecoin developers aimed to further focus on improving anonymity between senders and receivers.

Following the MimbleWimble upgrade at Litecoin block 2,257,920, users could opt for moe transaction privacy and explore other benefits, including blocks containing less needless transaction data. More specifically, long transactions are broken down into a single transfer by recording one input-output pair.

The MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB) upgrade was successfully activated on May 19, 2022. However, the upgrade puts Litecoin in the crosshairs of regulators who do not take kindly to privacy-capable cryptocurrencies.

Some effects of the upgrade became rather apparent when several South Korean exchanges started delisting Litecoin from their platforms shortly after the MWEB upgrade went into effect. Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax have delisted LTC over the MimbleWimble upgrade, due to how it makes it impossible for these companies to adhere to the Act on the Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information. Per South Korean regulation, crypto exchanges need to mitigate money laundering and illicit activities at all costs. That means removing any currencies that provide users with additional privacy or anonymity.

#### How Many Litecoin (LTC) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Like most proof-of-work ([POW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) cryptocurrencies, the amount of Litecoin in circulation gradually increases with each newly mined block.

As of January 2021, 66.245 million LTC have already been mined out of a total maximum supply of 84 million. The Litecoin Foundation recently estimated it will be well over 100 years until Litecoin reaches full dilution (around the year 2140) — since the number of LTC mined per block decreases every four years as part of the block reward halving schedule.

Around 500,000 LTC was instamined on day one after the LTC genesis block was mined and Charlie Lee and presumably other early Litecoin developers were among the first miners.

Despite this, as a fairly distributed asset, the Litecoin developers or Charlie Lee do not receive any direct profits from the operation of Litecoin—other than anything they may earn as part of the regular mining process.

When Litecoin listed on several markets in 2011, the Litecoin price hit $0.30. Then, from November to December 2013, it went on a massive bull run, with Litecoin price hitting a high of $44.73. However, the bear market and [Mt. Gox hack](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mt-gox) caused Litecoin prices to crash in 2014, and prices consolidated within the $2 to $4 range for several years. In November and December of 2017, Litecoin price rallied over 500% to $358.34, on the back of the crypto bull market. Litecoin price hit an all-time high in May 2021, in the latest crypto bull run, which saw it reach $386.45 on May 9, 2021.


### How Is the Litecoin Network Secured?

As a blockchain-based cryptocurrency, Litecoin is secured by incredibly strong cryptographic defenses — making it practically impossible to crack.

Like Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies, Litecoin uses the PoW [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) algorithm to ensure transactions are confirmed quickly and without errors. The combined strength of the Litecoin mining network prevents double-spends and a range of other attacks, while ensuring the network has 100% uptime.

Civic,CVC,civic,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1816.png,token,"## What Is Civic (CVC)?

Civic is a [blockchain-based](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) identity management solution that gives individuals and businesses the tools they need to control and protect personal identity information. 

The platform is designed to change the way we think about identity verification by giving users more control over their personal data, while allowing them to access a wide range of services without needing to fork over excessive amounts of personal information.

Civic's identity verification solution uses distributed ledger technology to authorize identity usage in real time, and is used to sparingly share information with Civic partners after authorization by the user. 

Unlike some other identity management services, Civic users store all their sensitive data on their mobile device. Users are able to authorize the sharing of specific personal data by providing a biometric signature through the Civic app. 

The Civic ecosystem is enabled by a unique utility token known as the Civic token (CVC), which is used for the settlement of identity-related transactions between Civic participants — such as between a customer and service provider.

Users can earn CVC tokens for completing a variety of tasks, such as signing up for a service through the platform or introducing new users, while validators can earn CVCs for validating documents for service providers.

Civic was launched in 2018, following a sell-out initial coin offering ([ICO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-coin-offering-ico)) the year prior.


## Who Are the Founders of Civic?

Civic was co-founded in 2015 by Vinny Lingham and Jonathan Smith.

Vinny Lingham is a serial entrepreneur who appeared on Shark Tank South Africa in 2016, and has co-founded several prominent firms, including a South Africa-based investment fund known as Newtown Partners and Gyft — a Google ventures-backed digital card platform. Lingham is Civic’s CEO. 

Jonathan Smith is the current CTO of the platform and has more than 15 years of experience in the banking industry. Prior to his role at Civic, Smith held various managerial roles at prominent firms, including Deloitte MCS Limited and HSH Nordbank, and was the global head of Platforms at Genpact Headstrong Capital Markets.

In addition to the founders, the Civic team includes a host of highly successful individuals, including COO Chris Hart, who has two decades of experience in senior finance, and previously held the role of CFO at Guidebook and Nextag. 

The official Civic LinkedIn page currently lists 38 employees, many of which are based in the San Francisco Bay Area.


#### What Makes Civic Unique?

Civic is built to make it easy for users to verify their identity with service providers, while still retaining full control over their personal information. 

It allows businesses to onboard users faster using its AI-powered verification system, which when combined with human review helps businesses cut down on fraud and stay compliant with AML regulations and OFAC rules.

As of December 2020, Civic has two main products: the Civic wallet and Health Key. 

The Civic wallet is a mobile cryptocurrency wallet that can be used to store a handful of popular cryptocurrencies, including [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [Ethereum (ETH)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), and [USD Coin (USDC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/). The app doubles as a digital identity management solution, and benefits from a $1 million Bitcoin insurance plan provided by Coincover. 

Health Key is Civic’s newest product. This is an app that allows employers to securely verify the health status of employees, to ensure they are healthy enough to return to the workplace after an infection with COVID19 — such as if they test positive for antibodies or have been vaccinated. This is achieved without compromising the privacy of the employee.

#### How Many Civic (CVC) Coins Are There in Circulation?

As of late December 2020, there are exactly 670 million CVC tokens in circulation, representing 67% of the maximum 1 billion CVC total supply. The current circulating supply can be found in the right data panel.

As per the Civic token sale website, a total of 1 billion CVC were minted, of which 33% were sold in the token sale; 33% is retained by Civic; 33% is allocated for incentives and rewards; and the remaining 1% was used to cover token sale costs.

As of December 2020, the 330 million tokens allocated to Civic remains untouched. It is currently being held in a multi-signature Ethereum wallet, which can be tracked [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0x41e5560054824ea6b0732e656e3ad64e20e94e45#balances). 


### How Is the Civic Network Secured?

As an [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) token, CVC is backed by the Ethereum blockchain — which is widely regarded to be of the most decentralized and secure [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POW) networks in current usage. 

Over time, [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) will gradually transition to [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (POS) with the roll-out of [Ethereum 2.0](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0). Once complete, the CVC token and associated transactions will be secured by a network of validator nodes.

Digital identities secured through the Civic app are protected by the user’s own device, which customers use to control access to their data. 


### Where Can You Buy Civic (CVC)?

The CVC token is highly liquid and can be traded on dozens of exchange platforms, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/) and [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/). It is most commonly traded against [Tether (USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)), the Korean won (KRW) and Bitcoin (BTC).

Moonsama,SAMA,exosama-network,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/23004.png,token,"Moonsama is a blockchain tailored to support the development of metaverses, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 gaming. It was created by a world-class team of blockchain engineers. Moonsama is a standalone network based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This makes it extremely developer-friendly, as it allows external projects to start building or migrate existing projects to Moonsama effortlessly and access its capabilities, including the ability to create and trade large volumes of tokenized in-game items and other NFTs in fields such as gaming, music and fashion.

Moonsama’s blockchain was launched in October 2022, about a year after its main governing collection launched and has since grown to over 30+ team members and have built active vibrant metaverses. This Layer 1 was built due to the increasing complexity of our family of products combined with the nearing risk of outgrowing the platforms where our technology was being deployed, calling for a tailor-made network rather than relying on third-party blockchains. It underpins the Moonsama ecosystem, which offers a variety of products and services such as: Multi-chain blockchain solutions, NFT collections, Games, Web3 assets, NFT marketplaces, and Metaverses.

Moonsama uses the revolutionary proof of authority (POA) consensus protocol using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from the Moonsama collection as a voting mechanism to govern the blockchain. This system has been tested in our ecosystem and has also gained the attention of Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum and Polkadot. It offers significant benefits to conventional PoS governance in terms of: Higher voter turnout Turning the voting process into a game Protection against manipulation.

The SAMA coin is the native currency used on Moonsama and is primarily used to pay for gas fees as well as being integrated into Moonsama’s services. It is optimized for large volumes of in-game items, governance, digital asset creation, and connecting Web3 and Web2 applications. The network has low transaction costs and fast block confirmations, averaging around 5 seconds with fees being low, making it suitable for large amounts of transactions for metaverses and gaming. Moonsama is tailored to the needs of gaming and NFTs in Web3.

Moonsama will eventually transfer into a fully-fledged Polkadot parachain to benefit from its interoperability with other blockchains, shared security mechanism and the tech needed to build out specific functionality for increased efficiency of the blockchain.

TRON,TRX,tron,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1958.png,coin,"## What Is TRON (TRX)?

TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017. Originally TRX tokens were [ERC-20](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20)-based tokens deployed on [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), but a year later they were moved to their own network.

Initially, the project was created with the aim of providing full ownership rights to makers of digital content. The main goal is to help content creators (who receive only a small part of the income) and encourage them with more rewards for their work. How: invite content consumers to reward content makers directly (without intermediaries like YouTube, Facebook or Apple). 

The TRON software supports [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract), various kinds of blockchain systems, and decentralized applications aka dApps. The cryptocurrency platform uses a transaction model similar to [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), namely UTXO. Transactions take place in a public ledger, where users can track the history of operations. 

Therefore, the platform was built to create a decentralized Internet and serves as a tool for developers to create dApps, acting as an alternative to Ethereum. Anyone can create [dApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) on the TRON network, offer content, and in return receive digital assets as compensation for their efforts. The ability to create content and share it openly without hesitation regarding transaction fees is an undeniable advantage of TRON.

**Network principles:**

The data hosted on the TRON network is free with no central authority. Content creators receive TRX tokens - a reward for their intellectual labour;

TRON supports the creation of coins by content makers, which can be used in their own developed applications;

TRON also carries out decentralized games on the network, players can encourage and reward creators with digital assets directly.

The ecosystem is based on three levels, which ensure the smooth and powerful operation of TRON. The architecture is as follows:



* Storage Layer, where network data, blockchain state and history data are securely stored. In general, its purpose is to segment all kinds of ecosystem data;
* Application Layer, where developers are key figures and where TRX is utilized to develop applications and create wallets;
* Core Layer, where various instructions are processed (which can be written only in two programming languages ​​- Solidity and Java). Principle of operation: the core layer computes instructions, processes them, and sends them to the Tron Virtual Machine, where the logic happens, and dApps are executed.

The main network protection tool, as well as one of the special features, is a delegated Proof-of-Stake ([dPoS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos)) system, an alternative to the Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work consensus algorithms. This is a competitive advantage of TRON, because it means that the network is far more energy-efficient. Furthermore, due to its layered architecture, TRON processes more transactions at once than Proof-of-Work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake)) systems. According to the development team, TRON has the higher throughput and is able to process up to 2000 operations per second without fees, thus, transactions on the network are feeless.


TRON is a blockchain-based operating system that aims to ensure this technology is suitable for daily use. Whereas Bitcoin can handle up to six transactions per second, and Ethereum up to 25, TRON claims that its network has capacity for 2,000 TPS.

To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of [Tron](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tron).

This project is best described as a decentralized platform focused on content sharing and entertainment — and to this end, one of its biggest acquisitions was the file sharing service BitTorrent back in 2018.

Overall, TRON has divided its goals into six phases. These include delivering simple distributed file sharing, driving content creation through financial rewards, allowing content creators to launch their own personal tokens and decentralizing the gaming industry.

TRON is also one of the most popular blockchains for building [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps).

## USDD Stablecoin

In April 2022, the CEO of Tron, Justin Sun, announced plans to launch an [algorithmic stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/algorithmic-stablecoin), dubbed Decentralized USD or [USDD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdd/). It requires an automated balancing technique that burns $1 worth of TRX to mint 1 USDD. Tron DAO Reserve is responsible for managing USDD and ensuring that its value is stable relative to the value of its underlying collateral. Also, it sets the [APY](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/annual-percentage-yield-apy) offered to users [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) USDD. At the time of writing, users earn a 30% yield on staked USDD.

While USDD has been criticized for borrowing heavily from the design of [UST](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terrausd/) — [Terra](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/)’s algorithmic stablecoin which set off what was essentially a bank run and crash of the Terra ecosystem — certain elements set it apart. Perhaps the most notable is the decision to opt for a guaranteed over-collateralized framework, in contrast to the undercollateralized model of UST. The cryptocurrencies used as collateral on the USDD protocol include Tron, [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/), [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) and [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/). 

The minimum collateral ratio of USDD has been set at 130%. Hence, the value of collateral deposited in the protocol's cryptocurrency reserves would, in practice, be higher than the value of USDD in circulation. With this, the possibility of a sustained depeg of USDD could be perceived as low. Despite its 130% minimum collateral ratio, USDD is at the time of writing backed by collateral reserves collectively worth over thrice the value of USDD in circulation. For the Tron DAO Reserve, the goal is to build a $10 billion treasury to back the value of USDD. 

Another core element that is key to the stability of USDD is the operation of Super Representatives, which are Tron's institutional partners. The super representatives are incentivized entities that influence either side of the trade to absorb the potential volatility of the price of USDD. For instance, when the price of USDD falls below $1, the super representatives burn part of their USDD holding to mint TRX. This will, in turn, bring the value of USDD to the target price.

However, all these stability mechanisms have not stopped USDD from facing its fair share of volatility as the stablecoin. In June 2022, it experienced a 9% fall in its price relative to the value of 1 USD. In response, Tron DAO Reserve infused $650 million worth of USDC into USDD's collateral reserve.

## Who Are the Founders of TRON?

TRON was founded by Justin Sun, who now serves as CEO. Educated at Peking University and the University of Pennsylvania, he was recognized by Forbes Asia in its 30 Under 30 series for entrepreneurs.

Born in 1990, he was also associated with Ripple in the past — serving as its chief representative in the Greater China area.

### What Makes TRON Unique?

TRON has positioned itself as an environment where content creators can connect with their audiences directly. By eliminating centralized platforms — whether they are streaming services, app stores or music sites — it is hoped that creators won’t end up losing as much commission to middlemen. In turn, this could also make content less expensive for consumers. Given how the entertainment sector is increasingly becoming digitized, TRON could have a headstart in applying blockchain technology to this industry.

The company also says that it has a talented and experienced developer team, based around the world, that has been drawn from major companies such as Ripple Labs.

Last but not least, whereas some other blockchain projects can be opaque about their plans for development, TRON offers a point of difference by delivering a roadmap that shows its intentions for the coming years.

[What Is A Crypto Faucet?](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-crypto-faucet)

### How Many TRON (TRX) Coins Are There in Circulation?

TRON has a total supply of just over 100 billion tokens — and at the time of writing, about 71.6 billion of these are in circulation.

When a token sale was held in 2017, 15.75 billion TRX was allocated to private investors, while an additional 40 billion were earmarked for initial coin offering participants. The Tron Foundation was given 34 billion, and a company owned by Justin Sun got 10 billion.

All in all, this meant that 45% of TRX supply went to the founder and the project itself, while 55% was distributed among investors. Critics argue that this is a much higher ratio than what has been seen with other cryptocurrency projects.

### How Is the TRON Network Secured?

TRON uses a consensus mechanism that is known as [delegated proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos).

TRX owners can freeze their cryptocurrency in order to get Tron Power, which means that they can vote for “super representatives” who serve as block producers.

These block producers receive TRX rewards in exchange for verifying transactions, and these rewards are then distributed among the people who voted for them.

According to TRON, this approach helps its blockchain to achieve higher levels of throughput. 

### Where Can You Buy TRON (TRX)?

It is possible to [buy Tron](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-TRON) from dozens of the exchanges it is listed on - including Poloniex, Bancor, KuCoin, Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbene and others. However, it is not supported by Coinbase.

Casper,CSPR,casper,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/5899.png,coin,"## What Is Casper (CSPR)?
 
Launched on mainnet on March 30, 2021, Casper is the first live proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain built off the Casper CBC specification. The Casper platform is designed to boost the adoption of [blockchain technology](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain), smart contracts, and DApps on a global scale.
 
With its future-proof architecture, Casper is designed to ensure the platform is continually developed according to the evolving needs of its users, and that it’s maximally accessible to developers of all backgrounds. As per the official whitepaper, Casper is optimized to suit both enterprise and developer needs. Casper’s mission is to usher in a new era for Web3, as demand for intuitive, interconnected services continues to grow across the board. Casper does so by solving the adoption trilemma: offering enterprise-grade security, scalability and decentralization all within the same blockchain protocol. 
 
## Who Are the Founders of Casper?
 
### Medha Parlikar, Co-Founder and CTO
 
Medha is one of the co-founders of CasperLabs and serves as its CTO. She started working with technology in the early 80’s, building computers in her basement. Since then, she has spent the past two decades delivering production SaaS software for major corporations such as Adobe, Omniture, and Avalara.

## What Makes Casper Unique?
 
Casper is a unique utilization of blockchain technology and the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus method. Because of its completely decentralized approach, the network is extremely versatile in terms of use cases. Not only that, Casper boasts a future-proof design, with upgradeable smart contracts and predictable gas fees for transactions. Additionally, Casper is introducing a new standard for blockchain energy consumption, and is [136,000% more energy-efficient than Bitcoin](https://blog.casperlabs.io/new-power-usage-report-shows-the-casper-networks-impressive-energy-efficiency-relative-to-other-blockchain-protocols). 
 
The innovative Correct-by-Construction (CBC) Casper specification is a remarkable feature of the network. This specification allows for the rapid adoption of blockchain services on all enterprise levels. By relying on the PoS consensus, Casper ensures scalability and database management solutions. Casper and the CSPR token are the result of years of research by CasperLabs.
 
Further, CasperLabs exists to provide enterprise-level services and support for organizations building on the Casper Network, similar to how Red Hat supports organizations building within the Linux ecosystem. Thanks to the team’s unique experience running services at enterprise software organizations like Adobe, Avalara and Google, CasperLabs is uniquely poised to elevate Casper as the de facto blockchain for the growing number of enterprise organizations that want to build in Web3 environments, but require more dedicated levels of support than are possible from open-source, decentralized projects. 
 
## How Many Casper Coins (CSPR) Are There in Circulation?
 
The initial circulating supply of CSPR breaks down as follows:
 
* 400M CSPR released from the freely traded tranche of Casper’s Public Sale on [Coinlist](http://coinlist.co/casper).
* Approximately 183M CSPR provided as liquidity to exchanges
* The portion of seigniorage estimated to be allocated to the released tokens above to date. This number updates in real time as seigniorage is issued.
 
Additional tranches of CSPR are held by various ecosystem participants, including Validator Node operators, the Casper Foundation, the Team and Advisors, the DAO in charge of Developer Incentives and CasperLabs AG, as shown in the chart below.
 

.

## How Is the Casper Network Secured?
 
The Casper Network relies on a PoS consensus mechanism for its network security. PoS depends on token staking to select node validators, which allows the consensus to be extremely versatile and scalable. Unlike the proof-of-work ([PoW](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)) consensus used by the Bitcoin blockchain, PoS does not require huge amounts of electrical or computing power to perform validations and to add new blocks to the chain. 
 
Casper also employs the Correct-by-Construction (CBC) Casper specification, which utilizes an upgraded approach to Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) applications. Casper’s enterprise-grade architecture has completed multiple security audits, most recently with Trail of Bits in January 2021, which found zero high severity results and confirmed that Casper “showed proper use of security hygiene.” 

## Where Can You Buy Casper Coins (CSPR)?

CSPR is available for trading on a growing number of exchanges, with a number of [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) trading pairs currently available. [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/) is currently the most active platform for trading CSPR, and other available exchanges include:

Zcash,ZEC,zcash,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1437.png,coin,"## What Is Zcash (ZEC)?

Zcash is a decentralized cryptocurrency focused on [privacy](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-privacy-coins) and anonymity. It uses the zk-SNARK zero-knowledge proof technology that allows nodes on the network to verify transactions without revealing any sensitive information about those transactions.

Contrary to a common misunderstanding, the majority of cryptocurrencies on the market, including Bitcoin ([BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)), are not anonymous, but rather [pseudonymous](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/is-cryptocurrency-anonymous); while they do not explicitly reveal the identities of their users, each user has their own public address or addresses which can be traced back to them via the methods of data science and [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) forensics.

Zcash transactions, on the other hand, still have to be relayed via a public blockchain, but unlike pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, ZEC transactions by default do not reveal the sending and receiving addresses or the amount being sent. There is an option, however, to reveal this data for the purposes of auditing or regulatory compliance.

Zcash was first released on October 28, 2016, and it was originally based on Bitcoin’s codebase.


### Who Are the Founders of Zcash?

Zcash was founded in 2016 by cypherpunk, computer security expert and entrepreneur Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn. He is also the founder of the for-profit Electronic Coin Company (ECC), which manages the development of Zcash.

Wilcox-O’Hearn has spent more than 25 years in the industry of cryptography and information security and has contributed to a number of projects, including the now-defunct electronic money firm DigiCash, peer-to-peer data storing software Mojo Nation and the Tahoe Least-Authority File Store filesystem.

He also founded Least Authority Enterprises, a technology company focused on improving digital security and preserving the fundamental right to privacy, and co-invented the BLAKE3 cryptographic hash function.


#### What Makes Zcash Unique?

Zcash’s main advantage lies in its optional anonymity, which allows for a level of privacy unattainable with regular, pseudonymous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).

ZEC transactions can be sent in two ways: transparent and shielded. Transparent transactions work in about the same way as in [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-a-bitcoin-transaction-take), whose codebase Zcash was originally based on: they are sent between public addresses and are recorded on an immutable public ledger (the blockchain). All essential information about these transactions is available online for anyone to see, including the sending and receiving addresses and the amount sent.

These public transactions do not reveal user identities in an overt manner: the only identifiers an outside observer can access from the blockchain are public addresses. However, through the efforts of data scientists and law enforcement over recent years, the methods of blockchain analysis have been developed to the point where an interested party can fairly reliably connect a public address on a blockchain to the real-world identity of its owner, essentially making private transactions impossible.

Shielded ZEC transactions, on the other hand, leverage the technology of zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge, or [zk-SNARKs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zk-snarks), in order to enable completely anonymous transactions to be sent over a public immutable blockchain. The fact that the transaction _has _happened is recorded on the ledger, but the sending and receiving addresses and the amount sent is not revealed to the public.

This allows Zcash to offer its users the right to privacy while still enjoying the advantages of a decentralized, permissionless digital currency.

#### How Many Zcash (ZEC) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Overall, Zcash tokenomics is similar to that of Bitcoin: it is a scarce [mineable](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-mined-coins) token with a total supply limit of 21 million coins.

New ZECs are created in the form of “block subsidies”: whenever [a new block is mined](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/mining-zcash-explained) and added to the end of the blockchain, a certain amount of coins is minted and split into “miner subsidy” and “founders’ reward” at a ratio of 80 to 20 percent respectively. The block subsidy is halved at regular intervals to slow down the issuance rate as the total supply of ZEC approaches its limit of 21 million.

The miner subsidy goes to the miner who has mined the latest block and the founders’ reward is distributed between Electronic Coin Company (ECC) founders, Zcash Foundation and ECC itself, as well as its employees. On Nov. 18, 2020, the block subsidy was halved from 6.25 ZEC to 3.125 ZEC, which was triggered at block 1,046,400. This was introduced under the [Zcash Canopy](https://z.cash/upgrade/canopy/) upgrade, which also removed the Founders Reward. Instead, the remaining 20% will be divided among the Major Grants Fund, ECC and Zcash Foundation, at 8%, 7% and 5% respectively. The next, and fifth, [Zcash network upgrade](https://z.cash/upgrade/) — [Zcash NU5](https://z.cash/upgrade/nu5/) — is estimated to go live on the testnet on Sept. 30, 2021. 

Since launch there has been substantial interest in the [ZEC to AUD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zcash/zec/aud/) and [ZEC to EUR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zcash/zec/eur/) price pairs.


### How Is the Zcash Network Secured?

Zcash network is secured by the [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) [SHA-256](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sha-256) hash function which belongs to the SHA-2 set of algorithms — same as Bitcoin.


### Where Can You Buy Zcash (ZEC)?

Zcash is a high-ranking cryptocurrency. It is possible to [buy Zcash](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Zcash) on a number of major exchanges, some of which are:

*   [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/)

Aptos,APT,aptos,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/21794.png,coin,"## What Is Aptos?

Aptos is a [Layer 1](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) [Proof-of-Stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos) (PoS) blockchain that employs a novel [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) programming language called Move, a Rust-based programming language that was independently developed by Meta (formerly Facebook)’s Diem blockchain engineers.

Aptos’s vision is a blockchain that brings mainstream adoption to [web3](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-web-3-0) and empowers an ecosystem of [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) to solve real-world user problems.

The PoS blockchain can achieve a theoretical transaction [throughput](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/throughput) of over 150,000 [transactions per second](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/transactions-per-second) (tps) through parallel execution.

In March 2022, Aptos raised $200 million in a seed round led by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Other crypto heavyweights like Tiger Global and Multicoin Capital took part in the funding round. Fast forward to July, the startup raised another $150 million in a Series A round led by Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX Ventures and Jump Crypto.

Two months later, Binance Labs made a strategic investment of an undisclosed amount in Aptos, bringing its valuation to $4 billion in September.

On Oct. 18, 2022, Aptos announced the [mainnet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mainnet) launch, while the Aptos genesis occurred on Oct. 12, 2022.


## Who Are the Founders of Aptos?

Aptos is the brainchild of Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching, both former employees of Meta. Mo, who is the current CEO of the company, is a founder with years of multinational financial services and blockchain/crypto experience. According to his [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moalishaikh/details/experience/), he specializes in scaling products and has experience in the private equity and venture capital markets. 

Ching, on the other hand, is the CTO of Aptos. He is a software engineer and was one of the principal software engineers at Meta.

The duo worked together on the Diem blockchain project at Meta. Shaikh and Ching decided to join forces to create Aptos Labs when the Diem project was discontinued in January 2022. It, therefore, comes as no surprise that Aptos employs some of the technicalities of Diem.

Other members of the Aptos team include researchers, designers, and engineers from Diem.


## What Makes Aptos Unique?

For a start, the Aptos team claims that its network can process over 150,000 tps. By comparison, Ethereum’s mainnet tps is around 12 to 15.

This high transaction throughput is possible through a parallel execution engine (Block-STM) — a [byzantine fault-tolerant](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft) (BFT) PoS [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism). For context, most blockchains execute transactions sequentially, which means that a single failed transaction or high demand on the network could hold up the entire chain.

In the case of Aptos, all transactions are processed simultaneously and validated afterward. Failed transactions are either re-executed or aborted, thanks to the blockchain’s software transactional memory libraries, which spot and manage conflicts.

Aptos is built using Move, a new smart contract programming language that claims to offer advantages to [Solidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-learn-solidity-for-beginners), the EVM-based programming language. This includes blockchain commands that can be easily verified, modification of private key and modular design of Aptos.

New use cases can be realized through Aptos’ upgradeability and configurability, while horizontal throughput scalability — through the natively-implemented [sharding](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sharding) feature — provides a better user experience.

## How Much Aptos is in Circulation?

APT is the native currency of the Aptos blockchain. It has an initial total supply of 1 billion and at the time of writing, its circulating supply is 130 million APT.

The distribution is as follows: Community (51.02%); Core Contributors (19.00%); Foundation (16.50%); Investors (13.48%).

Under the Community allocation, around 80% are held by the Aptos Foundation and the remaining by Aptos Labs. This will be used to support community growth and Aptos Foundation initiatives, and the remainder will be unlocked monthly over the next ten years.

Investors and core contributors are subjected to a four-year [vesting](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-does-vesting-mean-in-crypto) schedule from mainnet launch. The Aptos team announced a token airdrop of 20 million APT tokens to early testnet users on Oct. 19, 2022.

For a summary of Aptos [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/tokenomics), refer [here](https://aptosfoundation.org/currents/aptos-tokenomics-overview).


### Aptos Mainnet Launch

As already mentioned, despite raising millions of dollars from investors, Aptos did not launch its mainnet until October 2022. Prior to the mainnet launch, its testnet campaign called “Aptos Incentivized Testnet (AIT)” was running since May.

The testnet was divided into four stages – [AIT1](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/completing-ait1-ait2-in-hot-pursuit-3f159f4bfb8b), [AIT2](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-incentivized-testnet-2-highlights-and-updates-ee478eace33c), [AIT3](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/welcome-to-aptos-incentivized-testnet-3-9d7ce888205c), and [AIT4](https://aptoslabs.medium.com/the-journey-from-ait3-to-longevity-testnet-6d888885a7d0). The aim of the campaign was to invite and incentivize developers, node operators, and auditors to launch applications and stress-test the network, ahead of the mainnet launch.

On September 9, 2022, the network completed its AIT3 campaign, paving a way for the final testnet. Through the series of testnets, Aptos onboarded over 100 projects, including Solrise Finance, PayMagic, Pontem Network, and MartianDAO.

On Oct. 18, 2022, Aptos went live with its mainnet launch, making it the first blockchain to debut on Move technology. At the time this content was published, the mainnet was using the latest version of AptosBFT (version 4), which leverages a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol. However, the company is already working on AptosBFT (version 5).


### What Is Aptos Bridge?

On-chain user application protocol called LayerZero Labs [launched](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/the-aptos-bridge-by-layerzero-5117030afd4f) the Aptos Bridge on October 19, 2022.

The blockchain bridge will allow users to transfer ETH, USDC, and USDT from Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and Optimism to Aptos.


## How Is the Aptos Network Secured?

Aptos uses two consensus protocols – Proof-of-Stake and AptosBFT. 

AptosBFT is quite similar to DiemBFT, originally developed for Diem. “BFT '' means ‘Byzantine Fault-Tolerant,’ and a network is said to be Byzantine fault-tolerant if it can continue to operate normally even if some of its members go offline or turn malicious.

AptosBFT is a custom-made consensus algorithm based on the HotStuff protocol. While there are a lot of background technicalities around how the protocol secures the network, the algorithm analyzes the on-chain state and automatically updates leader rotations to adjust for non-responsive validators without human intervention.


## Where Can I Buy Aptos?

The APT token can be purchased and traded on a number of exchanges, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [Huobi](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/), [Coinbase](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/) and more.","{""website"":[""https://aptoslabs.com""],""technical_doc"":[""https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/developer-docs-site/static/papers/whitepaper.pdf""],""explorer"":[""https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/"",""https://aptoscan.com/"",""https://tracemove.io/coin/0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin"",""https://apscan.io/""],""source_code"":[],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/Aptos_CMC"",""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/aptos""],""chat"":[""https://t.me/AptosLabs""],""announcement"":[],""reddit"":[],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/aptoslabs""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/21794.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin"",""ContractPlatform"":""Aptos"",""ContractPRCURL"":[],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://tracemove.io/coin/0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin""}]",[],"[{""Auditor"":""CertiK"",""ReportUrl"":""https://cmc.certik-skynet.com/redirect?project=aptos""}]"
Aergo,AERGO,aergo,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/3637.png,token,"## What is Aergo?

Aergo describes itself as an open-source enterprise blockchain platform optimized for hybrid deployments, which consist of both permissioned and permissionless blockchain architectures. It includes support for SQL allowing for easy data handling and familiar smart contract programming for developers.

The platform is built and utilized by Blocko, the Samsung-backed South Korean blockchain technology company that, according to Korean media sources, has deployed production blockchain solutions for large-scale clients including Lotte Card, Shinhan Bank, Korea Exchange, Hyundai Motors, and more.

## What are its use cases?

Designed for enterprise use cases, Aergo provides infrastructure for enterprises and developers to host DApps based on the Aergo Chain. Aergo offers a smart contract engine supporting Lua and SQ. Private blockchains on the Aergo platform run on a Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism powered-RAFT algorithm, while the public blockchain network, the Aergo mainnet, runs on a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Delegated Proof-of-Stake mechanism. To vote and manage block producers, Users are able to use the platform to pay enterprise-grade cloud providers such as large telecommunications firms to host their private blockchains on dedicated nodes. 

Blocko’s future services will be based on Aergo Enterprise products that require AERGO tokens to work. An example use case includes a solution deployed by Lotte Card for fingerprint credit card verifications. The solution is built using a version of Aergo’s Lua smart contracts with SQL integration, which has reportedly saved Lotte Card 90% of their manual security expenditures for fingerprint authentication. Clients include POSCO, Korea Stock Exchange, Shinhan Bank, and Hyundai Motor Group.","{""website"":[""https://www.aergo.io/""],""technical_doc"":[""https://paper.aergo.io/AERGO_Whitepaper_v5.2.pdf""],""explorer"":[""https://etherscan.io/token/0x91af0fbb28aba7e31403cb457106ce79397fd4e6"",""https://explorer.binance.org/asset/AERGO-46B""],""source_code"":[""https://github.com/aergoio""],""message_board"":[""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/Aergo"",""https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/aergo"",""https://medium.com/aergo""],""chat"":[""https://t.me/aergoofficial""],""announcement"":[],""reddit"":[""https://reddit.com/r/Aergo_Official""],""facebook"":[],""twitter"":[""https://twitter.com/AERGO_IO""]}","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1839.png"",""ContractAddress"":""AERGO-46B"",""ContractPlatform"":""BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2)"",""ContractPRCURL"":[],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://explorer.binance.org/asset/AERGO-46B""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/1027.png"",""ContractAddress"":""0x91af0fbb28aba7e31403cb457106ce79397fd4e6"",""ContractPlatform"":""Ethereum"",""ContractPRCURL"":[""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org"",""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"",""https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443""],""ContractExplorerURL"":""https://etherscan.io/token/0x91af0fbb28aba7e31403cb457106ce79397fd4e6""}]","[{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9022.png"",""Name"":""Trust Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.trustwallet.com/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9025.png"",""Name"":""MetaMask"",""URL"":""https://metamask.io/""},{""Logo"":""https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/9152.png"",""Name"":""Binance Chain Wallet"",""URL"":""https://www.binance.org/en/blog/binance-extension-wallet/""}]",[]

Dash,DASH,dash,https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/128x128/131.png,coin,"## What Is Dash (DASH)?

Dash is an open-source [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) and [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) focused on offering a fast, cheap global payments network that is decentralized in nature. According to the project's [white paper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper), Dash [seeks](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/wiki/Whitepaper) to improve upon [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) by providing stronger [privacy](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-privacy-coins) and faster transactions.

Dash, whose name comes from ""digital cash,"" was [launched](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=421615.0) in January 2014 as a fork of [Litecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/) (LTC). Since going live, Dash has grown to include features such as a two-tier network with incentivized nodes, including ""masternodes,"" and decentralized project governance; InstantSend, which allows for instantly settled payments; ChainLocks, which makes the Dash blockchain instantly immutable; and PrivateSend, which offers additional optional privacy for transactions.


### Who Are the Founders of Dash?

Dash was founded by software developers Evan Duffield and Kyle Hagan. The project was originally called XCoin, changing its name to Darkcoin two weeks later before [rebranding](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/official-statement-on-rebranding-to-dash.4297/) again to Dash in March 2015 in an effort to positively change its image.

Before launching Dash, Duffield was a software developer with experience in finance, from his time working at Hawk Financial Group, as well as in public relations, having developed machine learning algorithms and search engines. He first [conceived of](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/the-birth-of-darkcoin.162/) Dash in 2012 as a way to add more anonymity to Bitcoin — hence, originally calling it Darkcoin. Duffield has [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q0MiDNe6Wc) that he started it as a hobby, coding it in just one weekend. Duffield served as CEO of Dash Core Group — the company that supports the continued development, integrations and other activities of Dash — until December 2017 when he [stepped down](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/dash-core-team-organization-announcement.14434/) to focus on other strategic initiatives.

Hagan [co-authored](https://github.com/dashpay/docs/raw/master/binary/Dash%20Whitepaper%20-%20Darkcoin.pdf) the original Darkcoin whitepaper alongside Duffield. However, he [left](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/kyle-hagan-is-no-longer-part-of-the-development-team.3225/) the project early on in December 2014.


### What Makes Dash Unique?

According to its website, the [goal](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/introduction/about.html) of Dash is ""to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused cryptocurrency in the world."" To accomplish this, the project relies on a network of masternodes, which are servers backed by collateral held in Dash that are designed to provide advanced services securely and governance over Dash's proposal system. In exchange for part of the block rewards, masternodes provide a second layer of services to the network. They facilitate functions such as InstantSend, PrivateSend and ChainLocks.

Dash is marketed to both individual users and institutions, including merchants, financial services, traders and those who need to send international remittances. In October 2020, Dash Core Group [reported](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/dash-core-group-q3-quarterly-call-29-10-2020.50832/) that its strategic objectives moving forward include building its ecosystem and brand, ensuring that users are satisfied and further advancing the technology behind the network.

Dash's governance system, or treasury, distributes 10% of the block rewards for the development of the project in a competitive and decentralized way. This has allowed the creation of many funded organizations, including Dash Core Group. In addition, the Dash Foundation, which advocates for the adoption of the cryptocurrency, receives donations and offers paid individual and institutional memberships.

### How Many Dash (DASH) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The maximum number of Dash tokens that can be issued is 18,921,005. However, this figure ultimately depends on how the governance decides to allocate the 10% of block rewards reserved for budget proposals. If none were ever allocated, only 17,742,696 DASH would ever be emitted. New Dash tokens are [created](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/introduction/features.html#emission-rate) through a [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) mining algorithm in which the token emission rate is decreased by one-fourteenth, or approximately 7%, every 210,240 blocks, or about every 383 days.

Approximately 45% of new DASH is awarded to miners, 45% to masternodes and 10% to fund future proposals. In August 2020, a proposal was [approved](https://www.dashcentral.org/p/decision-proposal-block-reward-reallocat) that will, once in effect, change the ratio of coins awarded to miners and masternodes from 50/50 to 40/60, respectively.

Within the first 48 hours of Dash's launch, approximately 2 million coins were mined, which significantly exceeded the planned emission schedule. Dash was originally forked from Litecoin, which suffered a similar issue at its launch due to a bug in its difficulty adjustment algorithm. While it is well-documented that Dash inherited the bug from Litecoin, there has, nonetheless, been widespread speculation about whether the resulting fastmine was intentional to benefit early miners.


### How Is the Dash Network Secured?

Dash uses a two-tier network to secure its transactions. The first tier consists of nodes that carry out mining operations under a proof-of-work [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus) protocol, meaning that they compete to solve complex cryptographic problems and at least 51% of nodes must approve a transaction for it to be added to the blockchain. 

The PoW algorithm used by Dash is called ""X11"" — a custom hashing algorithm developed by Dash founder Duffield that uses a sequence of 11 hashing algorithms. According to Dash's [documentation](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/introduction/features.html#x11-hash-algorithm), X11 is ""one of the safest and more sophisticated cryptographic hashes in use by modern cryptocurrencies.""

The second tier consists of masternodes operating under a proof-of-service consensus algorithm in which masternodes are rated based on their history of providing good services to the network. Masternodes oversee the network and have the power to reject new blocks added by nodes if they were approved improperly. They also enable Dash's ChainLocks feature, which increases security because every 12 hours, a rotating group of masternodes observe and confirm all new blocks added to the blockchain. Dash's developers have [stated](https://blog.dash.org/mitigating-51-attacks-with-llmq-based-chainlocks-7266aa648ec9) that this protects the network against [51% attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack).
